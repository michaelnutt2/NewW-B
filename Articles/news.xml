<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>In an interview for the Axios HBO show, <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-ceo-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-mistake-92865f2a-d97c-4d6a-b171-5e7c0a69e77a.html">released Monday morning</a>, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi seemed to downplay last year's death of <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">CIA concluded</a> that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's assassination.</p>
<p>"It's a serious mistake," Khosrowshahi said. "We've made mistakes too, right, with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake. I think that people make mistakes, it doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they've taken it seriously."</p>

<p>Within hours—and before Axios published the comments—Khosrowshahi walked them back.</p>
<p>"I said something in the moment that I do not believe," he said in a statement to Axios. "When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused."</p>
<p>Axios's Dan Primack asked Khosrowshahi about the issue because Saudi Arabia's government is one of Uber's biggest shareholders. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, an official from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, sits on Uber's board.</p>
<p>When Axios asked if Al-Rumayyan should seek re-election to Uber's board, Khosrowshahi responded that he "has been a very constructive board member. I personally have valued his input greatly."</p>
<p>When Primack pointed out the CIA's findings—that far from being a mere "mistake," Salman had ordered Khashoggi's murder—Khosrowshahi said that he "didn't read that part of the CIA report."</p>
<p>"They're just like any other shareholder," Khosrowshahi said. "Now we're a public company. Anyone can invest in our company if they choose to do so."</p>
<p>An hour later, Khosrowshahi "called Axios to express regret for the language he used."</p>

          The Falcon 9 rocket is seen on Sunday, before going vertical at Space Launch Complex 40 in Florida.                      [credit:

      </ul>
  

<p>SpaceX has readied a Falcon 9 rocket and a second set of 60 Starlink satellites for a launch on Monday morning. The company is targeting 9:56am ET (14:56 UTC Monday) for liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Weather conditions appear to be favorable for the launch attempt.</p>
<p>After an "experimental" launch in May <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/spacex-returns-its-falcon-9-to-the-pad-for-another-starlink-launch-attempt/">of 60 satellites</a>, about 50 of which remain in orbit half a year later, SpaceX has made several modifications to this second batch of Starlink satellites.</p>
<p>"SpaceX has increased spectrum capacity for the end-user through upgrades in design that maximize the use of both Ka and Ku bands," the company stated in a news release. "Additionally, components of each satellite are 100% demisable and will quickly burn up in Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their life cycle—a measure that exceeds all current safety standards."</p>
<p>Starlink is intended to provide low-latency broadband Internet access around the world. By the middle of 2020, after six launches of satellites, the company plans to begin offering service to parts of North America through ground-based user terminals. Global coverage of the "populated world" will follow after the company completes 24 launches. The news release made no comment about efforts to minimize disruption to the night sky—about which astronomers have raised concerns—from a constellation that may one day include more than 10,000 satellites.</p>

<p>SpaceX is just one of several companies, including Amazon and OneWeb, racing to establish space-based Internet services from low-Earth orbit. With a second launch of maturing satellites, SpaceX appears to be leading the field. Although it represents an ambitious financial gamble for the company, the ability to fly 60 satellites at a time on reusable rockets would seem to give it an advantage over other competitors, which do not have such ready access to low-cost, rapid launch capabilities.</p>
<p>To that end, SpaceX <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/spacex-returns-to-the-launch-pad-for-a-second-starlink-mission/">will launch Monday's mission</a> on a Falcon 9 rocket first stage that has already flown three times. Moreover, the company will attempt to re-use a payload fairing for the first time. This means that about 80% of the rocket will consist of previously flown materials.</p>
<p>About 8 minutes after the launch, SpaceX will land the Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, about 45 minutes after liftoff, SpaceX’s two fairing recovery vessels, “Ms. Tree” and “Ms. Chief,” will attempt to recover the two fairing halves. One hour into the mission, the Starlink satellites are scheduled to be deployed at an initial altitude of 280km.</p>

<p>What's the likelihood that the next big "space western" film or TV series will succeed? The concept sounds great on paper: two genres colliding like a veritable peanut-butter-and-chocolate combo for nerds. And we'd like to be optimistic about the latest entry into this particular mashup, Disney+’s exclusive Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/disney-announces-new-star-wars-trilogy-live-action-tv-series/"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>, thanks to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/disney-leans-hard-into-space-western-territory-in-new-mandalorian-trailer/">some of the sexiest trailers Lucasfilm has ever produced</a>.</p>
<p>But entertainment has been trying to find the right balance between “western” and “space odyssey” for decades. Gene Roddenberry originally pitched <em>Star Trek</em> as a “wagon train to the stars.” The hottest guy in <em>Star Wars</em> was <a href="https://twitter.com/simonstalenhag/status/1193128007273197568">one cowboy hat away from going full John Wayne</a>. Yet most attempts tip face-first into the SyFy-style camp of <em>Cowboys vs Aliens</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Mandalorian</em> wasn’t made available for review ahead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/we-now-know-what-disney-will-look-like-plus-a-few-new-exclusive-series/">Disney+'s launch on Tuesday</a>, so it’s hard to know where it will land on the spectrum. Will it be an <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>-like success, or an <em>Attack of the Clones</em>-level bust? While we wait to find out, let us consider those who have succeeded in the space western pantheon, and those who have not.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0O29rZiIRA?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">A fan-made trailer for <em>Firefly: Season One</em>. </p></div>
<h2><em>Firefly</em>: "A leaf on the wind" as a country song</h2>
<p>The most critically successful space western, Firefly, of worked because it leaned heavily into romantic aspects. The setup borrowed heavily from the western genre’s post-Civil War origins, with Captain Malcolm Reynolds and first mate Zoe Washburne on the losing side of a great war. It took place on the edge of civilization, in frontier-like towns on distant planets. The soundtrack sounded straight out of a Ken Burns documentary. Mal wore the western-standard long leather duster and found himself in plenty of explicitly western tropes, like being thrown out the window of a space bar in "The Great Train Job."</p>
<p>But the show never tipped into cheese because the series carefully wove in many other tropes. This large-scale genre mixing, which was unlike anything on TV, meant that no one genre overwhelmed the story or became cliché. (The show's short run may have helped here, too.) The Chinese snatches of dialogue kept the western patois from becoming overwhelming. The alien Reavers and River's mysterious abilities pushed the sci-fi aspects forward. The series’ handlers never forgot that this was a space opera first and that the joy in watching was as much in the discovery of what’s out there as it was about the survival of the crew.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtrUhIuEqdY?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Babylon 5, season one credits roll. </p></div>
<h2><em>Babylon 5</em>: Stealthy western style</h2>
<p>Sometimes the most successful space westerns are the ones where you never know you’re watching a western at all. Take <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/08/j-michael-straczynski-wants-to-reboot-babylon-5-as-a-big-budget-movie/"><em>Babylon 5</em></a>. It was doing multi-season-long arcs before prestige TV was a spark in HBO’s eye. It was championing <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Alliance_Resistance">the Resistance</a> before Star Wars even considered prequels, let alone <em>The Force Awakens</em>. But most importantly, it built a series following the same western-themed “order from chaos” story <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=187916"><em>Deadwood</em></a> would tell a decade later.</p>
<p><em>Babylon 5</em> works for the opposite reasons of <em>Firefly</em>. All of the western bones are in the story’s skeleton: the frontier, plus a crew of characters working to establish a peaceful point of galactic diplomacy and trade. There’s the show’s emphasis in the first season that the <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Alliance">Earth Alliance</a> should have been on the losing end of a great war, once again echoing the western genre’s Civil War origins. But none of those things are obvious. Instead, audiences get caught up in the depiction of dozens of different alien races thrown together, the Shadow War and the prophecies <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/John_Sheridan">surrounding Sheridan</a>, and, of course, all those time-traveling caretaker <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Zathras">Zathras</a>.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDUqW3mIN7E?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Defiance</em> season two DVD trailer. </p></div>
<h2><em>Defiance</em>: Too bad it didn't defy genre-melding expectations</h2>
<p><em>Defiance</em>, which launched on SyFy in 2013, tried to apply the <em>Deadwood</em> model to a near-future scenario, where the alien collective known as Votans have ravaged the Earth and cities must rebuild from scratch. But from the outset, <em>Defiance</em> made the mistake of making everything too literal. Instead of applying the “wild west frontier” to space, this series is set where the city of St Louis was, and its iconic Gateway Arch (you know, the "Gateway to the West," nudge, nudge) still stands. It sounds like a clever conceit: a space western, right on the edge of the Old West, but with aliens. But the resulting series, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/06/defiance-interview/">the tie-in video game</a>, wound up lacking imagination (like the brothel being called the “NeedWant Bar”) and leading to hokey scenarios (like Nolan constantly torn between a “good woman” and a “bad girl”).</p>
<p>Centering the show in and around St. Louis also meant it could never leave the planet for any sustained length of time without blowing up the entire premise, foolishly landlocking the show on Earth. Then there are clichés, like the Hatfield/McCoy rivalry between Datak Tarr and Rafe McCawley, which were predictable from the moment they were introduced. Instead of breathing new life into a recognizable fable, Defiance's family-on-family squabbles played out more like a bad reality-TV series of easily telegraphed plot beats.</p>
<p>Most importantly, other series like <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Babylon 5</em> neatly sidestepped issues of the western genre's unfavorable representation of American Indians. <em>Defiance</em> fails this test. Its evil-alien population, the <a href="https://www.tor.com/2013/06/19/defiance-for-better-or-worse-a-syfy-western/">Irathient</a> people, embodies every ugly trope of the “native enemy”—and came during a TV era when the creators should’ve known better.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPEYpryMp2s?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><em>Solo</em> film trailer. </p></div>
<h2><em>Star Trek V</em> &amp; <em>Solo</em>: Features that didn't feature western inspirations well</h2>
<p>As long-running series, <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> are successful examples of the space western. Sure, there are <em>Trek</em> episodes like <a href="https://www.agonybooth.com/battle-of-the-star-trek-western-episodes-66463">The One Where Worf Wore A Cowboy Hat</a>. And Star Wars has its share of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN8zy_h4phE">desert planet scavengers</a>. But each tipped too far into camp in two particular feature-length examples.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> is famous for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-v-killed-franchise-30-years-1216680">nearly killing the franchise</a>. From the opening of Sybok's evil "faith healer" to the infamous campfire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqbSNERnc0">“Row, Row, Row Your Boat” singalong</a>, everything about this film is unintentionally funny. It might have worked in a 44-minute episode mixed in with other, far less openly western adventures. As a standalone, it was too much.</p>
<p><em>Solo</em> was Lucasfilm's last attempt at a space western story before this week’s release of <em>The Mandalorian</em>. There’s a lot wrong with <em>Solo</em>, from its lean on a “black characters die first” trope to the tone-deaf take that demanding equality should be treated as a punchline. But the insistence on taking Lucas’ vision of Han as a “space cowboy” and making it literal didn’t help. Solo already swashbuckled just fine without spelling it out (or giving his last name the dumbest reason for existing).</p>
<p>At least in terms of the genre’s history in recent pop culture, <em>The Mandalorian</em>’s space western stab is a potential risk for Disney+. Star Wars worked because it was a grand space opera that absorbed the western genre wholesale. Can it work stripped down to the essence of the space cowboy gunslinging his way through the galaxy? We only have one day to find out.</p>

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/11/russias-phobos-grunt-mars-probe-stranded-in-earth-orbit/">Phobos-Grunt</a>, perhaps the most ambitious deep space mission ever attempted by Russia, crashed down into the ocean at the beginning of 2012. The spacecraft was supposed to land on the battered Martian moon Phobos, gather soil samples, and get them back to Earth. Instead, it ended up helplessly drifting in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) for a few weeks because its onboard computer crashed just before it could fire the engines to send the spacecraft on its way to Mars.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/lou-friedman/3361.html">ensuing report</a>, Russian authorities blamed heavy charged particles in galactic cosmic rays that hit the SRAM chips and led to a latch-up, a chip failure resulting from excessive current passing through. To deal with this latch-up, two processors working in the Phobos-Grunt’s TsVM22 computer initiated a reboot. After rebooting, the probe then went into a safe mode and awaited instructions from ground control. Unfortunately, those instructions never arrived.</p>
<p>Antennas meant for communications were supposed to become fully operational in the cruise stage of Phobos-Grunt, after the spacecraft left the LEO. But nobody planned for a failure preventing the probe from reaching that stage. After the particle strike, the Phobos-Grunt ended up in a peculiar stalemate. Firing on-board engines was supposed to trigger the deployment of antennas. At the same time, engines could only be fired with a command issued from ground control. This command, however, could not get through, because antennas were not deployed. In this way, a computer error killed a mission that was several decades in the making. It happened, in part, because of some oversights from the team at the NPO Lavochkin, a primary developer of the Phobos-Grunt probe. During development, in short, it was easier to count the things that worked in their computer than to count the things that didn’t. Every little mistake they made, though, became a grave reminder that designing space-grade computers is bloody hard. One misstep and billions of dollars go down in flames.</p>
<p>Everyone involved had simply grossly underestimated the challenge of carrying out computer operations in space.</p>
<h2>Why so slow?</h2>
<p>Curiosity, everyone’s favorite Mars rover, works with two BAE RAD750 processors clocked at up to 200MHz. It has 256MB of RAM and 2GB of SSD. As we near 2020, the RAD750 stands as the current state-of-the-art, single-core space-grade processor. It’s the best we can send on deep space missions today.</p>
<p>Compared to any smartphone we wear in our pockets, unfortunately, the RAD750’s performance is simply pathetic. The design is based on the PowerPC 750, a processor that IBM and Motorola introduced in late 1997 to compete with Intel's Pentium II. This means that perhaps the most technologically advanced space hardware up there is totally capable of running the original <i>Starcraft</i> (the one released in 1998, mind you) without hiccups, but anything more computationally demanding would prove problematic. You can forget about playing <i>Crysis</i> on Mars.</p>
<p>Still, the price tag on the RAD750 is around $200k. Why not just throw an iPhone in there and call it a day? Performance-wise, iPhones are entire generations ahead of RAD750s and cost just $1k apiece, which remains much less than $200k. In retrospect, this is roughly what the Phobos-Grunt team tried to accomplish. They tried to boost performance and cut costs, but they ended up cutting corners.</p>
<p>The SRAM chip in the Phobos-Grunt that was hit by a heavily charged particle went under the name of WS512K32V20G24M. It was well known in the space industry because back in 2005, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1532657">T.E. Page and J.M. Benedetto</a> had tested those chips in a particle accelerator at the Brookhaven National Laboratory to see how they perform when exposed to radiation. The researchers described the chips as "extremely" vulnerable, and single-event latch-ups occurred even at the minimum heavy-ion linear energy transfer available at Brookhaven. This was not a surprising result, mind you, because WS512K32V20G24M chips have never been meant nor tested for space. They have been designed for aircraft, military-grade aircraft for that matter. But still, they were easier to obtain and cheaper than real space-grade memories, so the Russians involved with Phobos-Grunt went for them regardless.</p>
<p>"The discovery of the various kinds of radiation present in the space environment was among the most important turning points in the history of space electronics, along with the understanding of how this radiation affects electronics, and the development of hardening and mitigation techniques,” says Dr. Tyler Lovelly, a researcher at the US Air Force Research Laboratory. Main sources of this radiation are cosmic rays, solar particle events, and belts of protons and electrons circling at the edge of the Earth’s magnetic field known as Van Allen belts. Particles hitting the Earth’s atmosphere are composed of roughly 89% protons, 9% alpha particles, 1% heavier nuclei, and 1% solitary electrons. They can reach energies up to 10^19 eV. Using the chips not qualified for space in a probe that intended to travel through deep space for several years was asking for a disaster to happen. In fact, <i>Krasnaya Zvezda</i>, a Russian military newspaper, reported at that time that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/did-bad-memory-chips-down-russias-mars-probe">62% of the microchips used on the Phobos-Grunt were not qualified for spaceflight</a>. The probe design was 62% driven by a "let’s throw in an iPhone" mindset.</p>
<h2>Radiation becomes a thing</h2>
<p>Today, radiation is one of the key factors designers take into account when building space-grade computers. But it has not always been that way. <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/computers/ch1-1.html">The first computer</a> reached space onboard a Gemini spacecraft back in the 1960s. The machine had to undergo more than a hundred different tests to get flight clearance. Engineers checked how it performed when exposed to vibrations, vacuum, extreme temperatures, and so on. But none of those testes covered radiation exposure. Still, the Gemini onboard computer managed to work pretty fine—no issues whatsoever. That was the case because the Gemini onboard computer was too big to fail. <i>Literally</i>. Its whooping 19.5KB of memory was housed in a <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch1-2.html#16">700-cubic-inch box weighing 26 pounds</a>. The whole computer weighed 58.98 pounds.</p>

(credit: NASA)</p></div>Generally for computing, pushing processor technology forward has always been done primarily by reducing feature sizes and increasing clock rates. We just made transistors smaller and smaller moving from 240nm, to 65nm, to 14nm, to as low as the 7nm designs we have in modern smartphones. The smaller the transistor, the lower the voltage necessary to turn it on and off. That’s why older processors with larger feature sizes <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268328773_Design_Approaches_for_Radiation_Hardening_in_Digital_Circuits">were mostly unaffected by radiation</a>—or, unaffected by so-called single event upsets (SEUs), to be specific. Voltage created by particle strikes was too low to really affect the operation of large enough computers. But when space-facing humans moved down with feature size to pack more transistors onto a chip, those particle-generated voltages became more than enough to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Another thing engineers and developers typically do to improve CPUs is to clock them higher. The Intel 386SX that ran the so-called "glass cockpit" in space shuttles was clocked roughly at 20MHz. Modern processors can go as high as 5GHz in short bursts. A clock rate determines how many processing cycles a processor can go through in a given time. The problem with radiation is that a particle strike can corrupt data stored in an on-CPU memory (like L1 or L2 cache) only during an extremely brief moment in time called a latching window. This means in every second, there is a limited number of opportunities for a charged particle to do damage. In low-clocked processors like the 386SX, this number was relatively low. But when the clock speeds got higher, the number of latching windows per second increased as well, making processors more vulnerable to radiation. This is why radiation-hardened processors are almost always clocked way lower than their commercial counterparts. The main reason why space CPUs develop at such a sluggish pace is that pretty much every conceivable way to make them faster also makes them more fragile.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways around this issue.</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>Dealing with radiation</h2>
<p>"In the old days, radiation effects were often mitigated by modifications implemented in the semiconductor process,” says Roland Weigand, a VISI/ASIC engineer at the European Space Agency. "It was sufficient to take a commercially available information processing core and implement it on a radiation hardened process.” Known as radiation hardening by process, this technique relied on using materials like sapphire or gallium arsenide that were less susceptible to radiation than silicon in the fabrication of microprocessors. Thus, manufactured processors worked very well in radiation-heavy environments like space, but they required an entire foundry to be retooled just to make them.</p>
<p>"To increase performance we had to use more and more advanced processors. Considering the cost of a modern semiconductor factory, custom modifications in the manufacturing process ceased to be feasible for such a niche market as space,” Weigand says. According to him, this trend eventually forced engineers to use commercial processors prone to single-event effects. "And to mitigate this, we had to move to alternative radiation-hardening techniques, especially the one we call radiation hardening by design,” Weigand adds.</p>
<p>The RHBD (radiation hardening by design) process enabled manufacturers to use a standard CMOS (Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor) fabrication process. This way, space-grade processors could be manufactured in commercial foundries, bringing the prices down to a manageable level and enabling space mission designers to catch up a little to commercially available stuff. Radiation was dealt with by engineering ingenuity rather than the sheer physics of the material. "For example, Triple Modular Redundancy is one of the most popular ways to achieve increased radiation resistance of an otherwise standard chip,” Weigand explained. "Three identical copies of every single bit of information are stored in the memory at all times. In the reading stage, all three copies are read and the correct one is chosen by a majority voting.”</p>
<p>With this approach, if all three copies are identical, the bit under examination is declared correct. The same is true as well when just two copies are identical but a third is different; the majority vote decides which bit value is the correct one. When all three copies are different, the system registers this as an error. The whole idea behind the TMR is that copies are stored at different addresses in the memory that are placed at different spots on a chip. To corrupt data, two particles would have to simultaneously strike exactly where the two copies of the same bit are stored, and that is <i>extremely</i> unlikely. The downside to TMR, though, is that this approach leads to a lot of overhead. A processor has to go through every operation thrice, which means it can only reach one-third of its performance.</p>
<p>Thus, the latest idea in the field is to get space-grade processors even closer to their commercially available counterparts. Instead of designing an entire system on chip with radiation-hard components, engineers choose where radiation hardness is really necessary and where it can safely be dispensed with. That’s a significant shift in the design priorities. Space-grade processors of old were built to be immune to radiation. Modern processors are not immune anymore, but they are designed to automatically deal with all kinds of errors radiation may cause.</p>
<p>The LEON GR740, for example, is the latest European space-grade processor. It’s estimated to experience a staggering 9 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-event_upset">SEUs</a> a day on a geostationary Earth orbit. The trick is that all those SEUs are mitigated by the system and do not lead to functional errors. The GR740 is built to experience one functional error every 300 or so years. And even if that happens, it can recover just by rebooting.</p>

<h2>Europe goes open source</h2>
<p>The LEON line of space-grade processors working in <a href="https://indico.esa.int/event/182/contributions/1526/attachments/1400/1625/0905_-_Gaisler.pdf">SPARC architecture</a> is by far the most popular choice for space in Europe today. "Back in the 1990s, when the SPARC specification was chosen, it had significant industry penetration,” says Weigand. “Sun Microsystems was using SPARC on their successful workstations.” According to him, the key reasons behind going to SPARC were existing software support and openness. "An open source architecture meant anybody could use it without licensing issues. That was particularly important since in such a niche market as space, the license fee is distributed among a very limited number of devices, which can increase their prices dramatically," he explains.</p>
<p>Ultimately, ESA learned about the issues with licensing the hard way. The first European space-grade SPARC processor—the ERC32, which is still in use today—was using commercial information processing cores. It was based on an open source architecture, but the processor design was proprietary. "This led to problems. With proprietary designs you usually don’t have access to the source code, and thus making the custom modifications necessary to achieve radiation hardening is difficult,” says Weigand. That’s why in the next step, ESA started working on its own processor, named LEON. "The design was fully under our control, so we were finally free to introduce all RHBD techniques we wanted."</p>
<p>The latest development in the line of LEON processors is the quad-core GR740 clocked at roughly 250MHz. ("We’re expecting to ship first flight parts towards the end of 2019,” Weigand says.) The <a href="https://www.gaisler.com/doc/gr740/GR740-UM-DS-2-3.pdf">GR740 is fabricated in the 65nm process technology</a>. The device is a system-on-chip designed for high-performance, general-purpose computing based on the SPARC32 instruction set architecture. "The goal in building the GR740 was to achieve higher performance and capability to have additional devices included in one integrated circuit while keeping the whole system compatible with previous generations of European space-grade processors,” says Weigand. Another feature of the GR740 is advanced fault-tolerance. The processor can experience a significant number of errors caused by radiation and ensure uninterrupted software execution nonetheless. Each block and function of the GR740 has been optimized for best possible performance. This meant that components sensitive to single event upsets were used alongside the one that could withstand them easily. All SEU-sensitive parts have been implemented with a scheme designed to mitigate possible errors through redundancy.</p>
<p>For example, some flip-flops (basic processor components that can store either 1s or 0s) in the GR740 are off-the-shelf commercial parts known as CORELIB FFs. The choice to use them was made because they took less space on the chip and thus increased its computational density. The downside was that they were susceptible to SEUs, but this vulnerability has been dealt with by the Block TMR correction scheme where every bit read from those flip-flops is voted on by modules arranged with adequate spacing among them to prevent multiple bit upsets (scenarios where one particle can flip multiple bits at once). There are similar mitigation schemes implemented for L1 and L2 cache memories composed of SRAM cells, which are also generally SEU-sensitive. When the penalty such schemes inflicted on performance was eventually considered too high, ESA engineers went for SEU-hardened SKYROB flip-flops. Those, however, took twice the area of CORELIBs. Ultimately when thinking about space and computing power, there was always some kind of trade-off to make.</p>
<p>So far, the GR740 passed several <a href="https://www.gaisler.com/doc/gr740/GR740-RADS-1-1-1_GR740_Radiation_Summary.pdf">radiation tests </a>with flying colors. The chip has been bombarded with heavy ions with linear energy transfer (LET) reaching 125 MeV.cm^2/mg and worked through all of this without hiccups. To put that in perspective, feral SRAM chips that most likely brought down the Phobos-Grunt latched up when hit with heavy ions of just 0.375 MeV.cm^2/mg. The GR740 withstood levels of radiation over 300 times higher than what Russians had put in their probe. Besides a near-immunity to single-event effects, the GR740 is specced to take up to 300 krad(Si) of radiation in its lifetime. In the testing phase, Weigand’s team even had one of the processors irradiated to 292 krad(Si). Despite that, the chip worked as usual, with no signs of degradation whatsoever.</p>
<p>Still, specific tests to check the actual total ionizing dose the GR740 can take are yet to come. All those numbers combined mean that the processor working at the geostationary Earth orbit should experience one functional error every 350 years. In LEO, this time should be around 1,310 years. And even those errors wouldn’t kill the GR740. It would just need to do a reset.</p>

<h2>America goes proprietary</h2>
<p>"Space-grade CPUs developed in the US have traditionally been based on proprietary processor architectures such as PowerPC because people had more extensive experience working with them and they were widely supported in software,” says the Air Force Research Labs’ Lovelly. After all, the history of space computation began with digital processors delivered by IBM for the Gemini mission back in the 1960s. And the technology IBM worked with was proprietary.</p>
<p>To this day, BAE RAD processors are based on the PowerPC, which was brought to life by a consortium of IBM, Apple, and Motorola. Processors powering glass cockpits in the Space Shuttles and Hubble Space telescope were made in the x86 architecture introduced by Intel. Both PowerPC and x86 were proprietary. So in carrying with the tradition, the latest American design in this field is proprietary, too. Named <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180003537.pdf">High Performance Spaceflight Computing</a> (HPSC), the only difference is that PowerPC and x86 were best known from desktop computers. The HPSC is based on the ARM architecture that today works in most smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>The HPSC has been designed by NASA, Air Force Research Laboratory, and Boeing, which is responsible for manufacturing the chips. The HPSC is based on the ARM Cortex A53 quad-core processors. It will have two such processors connected by an AMBA bus, which makes it an octa-core system. This should place its performance somewhere in the range of mid-market 2018 smartphones like Samsung Galaxy J8 or development boards like HiKey Lemaker or Raspberry Pi. (That’s before radiation hardening, which will cut its performance by more than half that.) Nevertheless, we’re no longer likely to read bleak headlines screaming that 200 processors powering the Curiosity rover would not be enough to beat one iPhone. With the HPSC up and running, this is more likely to be three or four chips required to get iPhone-like computing power.</p>
<p>"Since we do not yet have an actual HPSC for tests, we can make some educated guesses as to what its performance may be like,” says Lovelly. Clock speed was the first aspect to go under scrutiny. Commercial Cortex A53 octa-core processors are usually clocked between 1.2GHz (in the HiKey Lemaker for example) and 1.8GHz (in the Snapdragon 450). To estimate what the clock speed would look like in the HPSC after radiation hardening, Lovelly <a href="https://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/E0/05/18/36/00001/LOVELLY_T.pdf">compared various space-grade processors with their commercially available counterparts</a>. "We just thought it reasonable to expect a similar hit on performance,” he says. Lovelly estimated HPSC clock speed at 500MHz. This would still be exceptionally fast for a space-grade chip. In fact, if this turned out to be true for the flight version, the HPSC would have the highest clock rate among space-grade processors. But more computing power and higher clock rates usually come at a dear price in space.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.baesystems.com/en/download-en/20190327203103/1434571328901.pdf">BAE RAD5545</a> is probably the most powerful radiation-hardened processor available today. Fabricated in the 45nm process, it is a 64-bit quad-core machine clocked at 466MHz with power dissipation of up to 20 Watts—and 20 Watts is a lot. A Quad Core i5 sitting in a 13-inch MacBook Pro 2018 is a 28 Watt processor. It can heat its thin aluminum chassis to really high temperatures up to a point where it becomes an issue for some users. Under more computationally intensive workloads, fans immediately kick in to cool the whole thing down. The only issue is that, in space, fans would do absolutely nothing, because there is no air they could blow onto a hot chip. The only possible way to get heat out of a spacecraft is through radiation, and that takes time. Sure, heat pipes are there to take excessive heat away from the processor, but this heat has to eventually go somewhere. Moreover, some missions have tight energy budgets, and they simply can’t use powerful processors like RAD5545 under such restrictions. That’s why the European GR740 has power dissipation at only 1.5 Watts. It’s not the fastest of the lot, but it is the most efficient. It simply gives you the most computational bang per Watt. The HPSC with 10 Watt power dissipation comes in at a close second, but not always.</p>
<p>"Each core on the HPSC has its own Single Instruction Multiple Data unit,” says Lovelly. "This gives it a significant performance advantage over other space-grade processors.” SIMD is a technology commonly used in commercial desktop and mobile processors since the 1990s. It helps processors handle image and sound processing in video games better. Let’s say we want to brighten up an image. There are a number of pixels, and each one has a brightness value that needs to be increased by two. Without SIMD, a processor would need to go through all those additions in sequence, one pixel after the other. With SIMD, though, the task can be parallelized. The processor simply takes multiple data points—brightness values of all the pixels in the image—and performs the same instruction, adding two to all of them simultaneously. And because the Cortex A53 was a processor designed for smartphones and tablets that handled a lot of media content, the HPSC can do this trick as well.</p>
<p>"This is particularly beneficial in tasks like image compression, processing, or stereo vision,” says Lovelly. "In applications that can’t utilize this feature, the HPSC performs slightly better than the GR740 and other top-performing space processors. But when it comes to things where it can be used, the chip gets well ahead of the competitors.”</p>

<h2>Making space exploration sci-fi again</h2>
<p>Chip designers in the US tend to go for more powerful, but more energy-hungry, space-grade processors because NASA aims to run more large-scale robotic and crewed missions compared to its European counterparts. In Europe, there are no current plans to send humans or car-sized planetary rovers to the Moon or Mars in the predictable future. The modern ESA is more focused on probes and satellites, which usually work on tight energy budgets, meaning something light, nimble, and extremely energy-efficient like the GR740 makes much more sense. The HPSC, in turn, has been designed from the ground up to make at least some of NASA’s at-times sci-fi ambitions reality.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, for instance, NASA’s Game Changing Development Program commissioned a study to determine what space computing needs would look like in the next 15 to 20 years. A team of experts from various NASA centers came up with <a href="https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/44422/13-2796_A1b.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">a list of problems advanced processors could solve in both crewed and robotic missions</a>. One of the first things they pointed to was advanced vehicle health management, which they deemed crucial for sending humans on long deep space missions. It boils down to having sensors constantly monitoring the health of crucial components. Fast processors are needed to get data from all those sensors at high frequencies. A sluggish computer could probably cope with this task if the sensor readouts got in every 10 minutes or so, but if you want to do the entire checkup multiple times a second to achieve something resembling real-time monitoring, the processor needs to be really fast. All of this would need to be devised to have astronauts seated in front of consoles showing the actual condition of their spaceship with voiced alerts and advanced graphics. And running such advanced graphics would also demand fast computers. The team called that "improved displays and controls.”</p>
<p>But the sci-fi aspirations do not end at flight consoles. Astronauts exploring alien worlds could likely have augmented reality features built right into their visors. The view of a physical environment around them will be enhanced with computer-generated video, sound, or GPS data. Augmentation would in theory provide situational awareness, highlighting areas worthy of exploring and warning against potentially dangerous situations. Of course, having the AR built into the helmets is only one possible option. Other notable ideas mentioned in the study included hand-held, smartphone-like devices and something vaguely specified as "other display capabilities" (whatever those other capabilities may be). Faster space-grade processors would be needed to power such computing advances.</p>
<p>Faster space-grade processors are meant to ultimately improve robotic missions as well. Extreme terrain landing is one of the primary examples. Choosing a landing site for a rover is a tradeoff between safety and scientific value. The safest possible site is a flat plane with no rocks, hills, valleys, or outcrops. The most scientifically interesting site, however, is geologically diverse, which usually means that it is packed with rocks, hills, valleys, and outcrops. So called Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN) capability is one of the ways to deal with that. Rovers equipped with the TRN could recognize important landmarks, see potential hazards, and navigate around them, narrowing down the landing radius to less than 100 meters. The problem is that current space-grade processors are way too slow to process images at such a rate. So the NASA team behind the study ran a TRN software benchmark on the RAD 750 and found the update from a single camera took roughly 10 seconds. Unfortunately, 10 seconds would be a lot when you’re falling down to the Martian surface. To land a rover within 100-meter radius, an update from a camera would have to be processed every second. For a pinpoint, one meter landing, estimates would need to come at 10Hz, which is 10 updates per second.</p>
<p>Other things on NASA’s computational wishlist include algorithms that can predict impending disasters based on sensor readouts, intelligent scheduling, advanced autonomy, and so on. All this is beyond the capabilities of current space-grade processors. So in the study, NASA engineers estimated how much processing power would be needed to efficiently run those things. They found that spacecraft health management and extreme terrain landing needed between 10 and 50 GOPS (gigaoperations per second). Futuristic sci-fi flight consoles with fancy displays and advanced graphics needed somewhere between 50 and 100 GOPS. The same thing goes for augmented reality helmets or other devices; these also consumed between 50 and 100 GOPS.</p>
<p>Ideally, future space-grade processors would be able to power all those things smoothly. Today, the HPSC running at <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180007636.pdf">a power dissipation between 7 and 10 Watts can process 9 to 15 GOPS</a>. This alone would make extreme landing possible, but the HPSC is designed in such a way that this figure can go up significantly. First, those 15 GOPS do not include performance benefits that the SIMD engine brings to the table. Second, the processor can work connected to other HPSCs and external devices like special-purpose processors, FPGAs, or GPUs. Thus, a future spaceship can potentially have multiple distributed processors working in parallel with specialized chips assigned to certain tasks like image or signal processing.</p>
<p>No matter where humanity’s deep space dreams go next, we won’t have to wait that long for engineers to know where the current computing power stands. The LEON GR740 is scheduled for delivery to ESA at the end of this year, and after a few additional tests it should be flight ready in 2020. The HPSC, in turn, is set for a fabrication phase that should begin in 2021 and last until 2022. Testing is expected to take a few months in 2022.</p>
<p>NASA should get flight-ready HPSC chips by the end of 2022. That means, all other complicating timeline factors aside, at least the future of space silicon appears on track to be ready for spaceships taking humans back to the Moon in 2024.</p>

<p>You are a polymath, a renowned scholar, and one of those philosophers who loves to tell everybody how important it is to do philosophy. You’re not perfect—one time, you wrote in a think-piece that we live in “the best of all possible worlds,” an argument that Twitter nobodies are still dunking on 300 years later—but in general, your thinking is rich, bold, and abstract. You write beautifully and love to share ideas. You have a profound faith in collaboration and the impartial search for truth.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you suck at academic knife-fights. Too naïve; too optimistic. Case in point: in your dispute with Isaac Newton, you accepted the British Royal Society as an impartial mediator, despite knowing that its leader at the time was literally Isaac Newton. Oh well. Your strategic stupidity may cost you in the short term. But sooner or later, history will appreciate your genius.</p>
<p>If you answered mostly B’s, then congratulations: you are a <b>NEWTON</b>!</p>

<p>You are viewed as an intimidating and extraordinary genius. Renowned poets are constantly dropping laudatory verses about you. Even when we know you’re wrong—like when you spent decades on crackpot theories of alchemy—we’re too awed to give you crap about it. You can also become, when the occasion demands, a stone-cold bitch. You refuse to lose any dispute, and you make quick knifework of your rivals (or, better yet, you have your loyal allies do the dirty work for you).</p>
<p>Is this ego run amok? Sure, in part. But it’s also single-mindedness. You’re not here to make friends; you’re here to solve problems and kick ass. It’s frustrating when “little baiters and smatterers” (your phrase, not mine) come pestering you with questions, or—even worse—trying to claim credit. You just want to think your thoughts. And even your rivals must admit: You think some darn good thoughts.</p>
<p>If you answered mostly C’s, then congratulations: you are <b>ONE OF THE MANY NAMELESS OTHERS WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CALCULUS</b>!</p>

<p>You lay the foundations for the Newtons and the Leibnizes. Or perhaps you extend and elaborate on their work. Or perhaps you solve the same problems, but in a different place, at a different time, as part of a different tradition. In any case, you’re a vital part of the history. Part of the history—yet not part of the story. A few heroes get starring roles; you get left on the cutting room floor. They get lionized; you get lost.</p>
<p>But hey, don’t let the cult of celebrity get you down. Calculus is yours as much as theirs. Ideas (like the ones that comprise calculus) are neither pure nor absolute. They draw their hues and shades from the intellectual context, the way crystals draw their color from trace elements. Each time a new person grasps calculus, something novel and irreproducible emerges; in short, calculus is discovered all over again.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Calculus has a formidable reputation as being difficult and/or unpleasant, but it doesn't have to be. Bringing humor and a sense of play to the topic can go a long way toward demystifying it. That's the goal of math teacher Ben Orlin's new book, <em>Change Is the Only Constant: The Wisdom of Calculus in a Madcap World,</em> a colorful collection of 28 mathematical tales connecting concepts in calculus to art, literature, and all manner of things human beings grapple with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>His first book, <em>Math with Bad Drawings</em>, after <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Orlin's blog</a> of the same name, was published last year. It included such highlights as placing a discussion of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_coefficient">correlation coefficient</a> and "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe%27s_quartet">Anscombe's Quartet</a>" into the world of Harry Potter and arguing that building the Death Star in the shape of a sphere may not have been Darth Vader's wisest move. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/09/the-math-of-why-its-so-hard-to-build-a-spherical-death-star-in-space/">We declared it</a> "a great, entertaining read for neophytes and math fans alike, because Orlin excels at finding novel ways to connect the math to real-world problems—or in the case of the Death Star, to problems in fictional worlds." And now, he has taken on the challenge of conveying the usefulness and beauty of calculus with tall tales, witty asides, and even more bad drawings.</p>

<p>Calculus boils down to two fundamental ideas: the derivative, which is a way of measuring instantaneous change, and the integral, which describes the accumulation of an infinite number of tiny pieces that add up to a whole. "The derivative is all about isolating a single moment in time, and the integral is all about gathering together an infinite stream of moments to develop a holistic picture," Orlin told Ars.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/304772/the-calculus-diaries-by-jennifer-ouellette/9780143117377/">like to think</a> of the derivative and the integral as the two ends of a hammer: one is for pounding in the nails, and the other is for pulling them out. The first is a process of subtraction and division; the second, a process of multiplication and addition. Each “undoes” the work of the other. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus">fundamental theorem of calculus</a> makes it possible to change one problem into another problem. For instance, if we have an equation that tells us the position of a falling apple, from that we can deduce the equation for the velocity of the apple at any given moment of its fall.</p>

<p>If calculus is so simple and straightforward, why does it strike fear and trepidation into the hearts of so many? It likely has something to do with the way in which it is traditionally taught. The experience of writing <em>Change Is the Only Constant</em> helped Orlin refine his ideas on how one might move away from longstanding dogma and rethink that traditional approach.</p>
<p>That said, while there are teaching notes included as appendices, this is not a textbook. "The book doesn't do much in the way of computation," he said. "It's more about telling stories about the concepts and applications." A Sherlock Holmes story, for instance, demonstrates how to use tangent lines to figure out which direction a bicycle was traveling from the tracks left in the mud.</p>

<p><strong>Ars Technica</strong>: <strong>Why did you choose to write about calculus for your second book?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ben Orlin</strong>: I was excited about calculus before I had an idea of how to tell the story. The first inklings of this book were probably back around 2012. I was working on a book that I called <i>The Rhyming Calculus Textbook</i>, written in Dr. Seuss style rhymes. It didn't quite pan out. It might have been okay as a companion text for a course, but it wasn't really a good way of popularizing calculus, because it was just too slavishly following the way the material is presented in a course.</p>
<p>Then I had a different approach: a book I called <i>The Poet's Calculus</i>, which was going to connect each idea in calculus to a different connection in the humanities. So the poetry of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Rich">Adrienne Rich</a> would be a metaphor for limits, and the paintings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Degas">Edgar Degas</a> would be connected to derivatives of motion, velocity, and acceleration. But that was a little too over-conceptualized. There were about three or four chapters that really worked and then the rest were pretty strange connections.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to build it around all my favorite stories that touched on calculus, stories that get passed around in the faculty lounge, or the things that the professor mentions off-hand during a lecture. I realized that all those little bits of folklore tapped into something that really excited me about calculus. They have a time-tested quality to them where they've been told and retold, like an old folk song that has been sharpened over time.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin5.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin5-640x356.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin5.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin5.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow"></a> (credit: Ben Orlin)</p></div>
<p><strong>Ars: You write that you found yourself moving away from the dogma of how calculus is traditionally taught—for example, not teaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)">limits</a> first and foremost. What are your thoughts on how we can better teach calculus?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Orlin</strong>: The way we teach calculus is shaped by two considerations. One is that we use calculus as a gatekeeping course very often. So even students who won't in their careers need calculus, wind up having to pass through it as this gauntlet to gain access to these selective educational opportunities. For that purpose as gatekeeper, we tend to really play up the pencil and paper, computational problem-solving aspects of it. To be fair, that’s an important aspect of calculus; you need to move through in a certain sequence. It's very clear you need to do derivatives before integrals, because to take an integral is to take an antiderivative, and that's a harder process. That winds up putting pretty firm constraints on how you can sequence things.</p>
<p>Since the early to mid-20th century, teaching calculus has also been driven by the desire for a rigorous axiomatic development—that is, wanting to start from first principles and make sure every theorem is proved and that every rule is justified in a way that is satisfying to mathematicians. Axiomatic proof is great for showing things are true in one sense, but it's not particularly resonant to students. That’s why limits are really foregrounded—because in some abstract sense, all of it is philosophically grounded in limits. But you really don't have to start with limits and make them the center of everything.</p>

<p><strong>Ars: I think most people who take calculus find that derivatives are pretty easy—the same process over and over, with a few exceptions that need to be memorized—but integrals are much harder, requiring a kind of intuition, or a bit of guesswork.  How do you teach something that is almost an art?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Orlin</strong>: To me, the dichotomy you're talking about is one of the most interesting things about calculus: that we have this complete and well-developed theory of derivatives that is quite mechanical. It's not hard to tell a computer how to take derivatives. With integrals, you can do it in one direction, but trying to do the reverse is very hard. And with derivatives there are maybe eight types of problems that you have to learn, while when it comes to integrals, there are essentially a limitless supply. So how do you teach it? I think it just takes a lot of patient practice.</p>
<p>There's an event called the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~pax/integrationbee.html">MIT Integral Bee</a>, founded by a professor at Harvey Mudd named <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/mathematics/people/faculty/andrew-bernoff/">Andy Bernoff</a> when he was an undergrad at MIT around 1980. Integrals are like English spellings, where they have a hundred different etymologies, and two that sound identical can actually be spelled very differently. Similarly, integrals that look almost identical might have very different solutions, so they have this fun puzzle-y aspect to them.</p>
<p>Bernoff’s observation is that integral skills have gotten a lot worse over the last 30-40 years for probably the same reason that our spelling has gotten a lot worse: we don't need it anymore. Computers are pretty good at fixing it. I think understanding the limitations of our theory of integrals is important, but learning a lot of the integration techniques maybe aren't worth such a featured spot in our secondary math curriculum.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin6.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin6-640x426.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin6.jpg 2x"></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orlin6.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow"></a> (credit: Ben Orlin)</p></div>
<p><strong>Ars: There <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/03/algebra-ii-has-to-go.html">have been calls</a> about revamping high school mathematical curricula to teach statistics, for example, as <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/make-us-do-the-math/">opposed to algebra</a> and calculus. What are your thoughts on that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Orlin</strong>: The questions are fair. And they demand that we reawaken our sense of the beauty and power of calculus. I think the different subjects accomplish different things. The kind of thinking you do in a calculus course is different from the kind of thinking you do in a good statistics course. I definitely don't like the idea of abolishing calculus. But I taught in the UK for a few years, where there are not separate courses for algebra and geometry and calculus and so on. It's an integrated math curriculum. Most countries work that way. You could move more of the math education into other subjects that are currently users of mathematics, like physics. In the UK, at least, the university system tends to work this way. If you're majoring in the sciences, you'll have math courses taught by the scientists. You won't go to the math department to take those courses.</p>
<p>There's something peculiar about the US where we stratify math. We carve out math as a separate discipline, with its own instructional approach. The US system winds up putting calculus on this pedestal as the culmination of secondary math education, when really, yes, it's a beautiful field of math, but it's just one important thread in a larger tapestry.</p>
<p><strong>Ars: One last question: how would you make the case for calculus to someone who is skeptical of its relevance, and maybe even a little math-phobic?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Orlin</strong>: Calculus takes the most vexing and mysterious things imaginable—motion, change, the flow of time—and boils them down to ironclad rules of computation. It takes this world of flux, which is totally ineffable, and reduces it to symbolic procedures and equations you can solve mechanically. That's a kind of magic that has inspired thinkers for generations. It inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy">[Leo] Tolstoy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges">[Jorge Luis] Borges</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>. It shaped visions of history, ethics, and the powers of the human mind. Calculus is the canonical example of turning the impossible into the routine, and its ideas have nourished not only science, but economics, philosophy, and even literature, too.</p>
<p>That's the case I wanted to make in this book. Not a defense of calculus as it's currently taught—heaven knows we could do better—but an exploration of the human side of calculus, what it has meant over the years to everyone from scientists to poets to philosophers to dogs. If calculus is going to remain a fixture of math education—even for those not pursuing STEM careers—then we need to bring out its humanity, to find a version of calculus that speaks to everyone.</p>

<p>We live on the most comfortable of planets. It may not be too visible, but the Earth's magnetic field plays a critical role in maintaining that comfort. The remaining rocky planets in our Solar System have much weaker magnetic fields and, as a result, are subject to a constant bombardment of high-energy particles from the Sun. Yes, our biosphere owes a great deal to a pool of molten iron at the core of our planet.</p>
<p>Yet the core presents something of a puzzle to us. The extreme conditions make it very hard to understand: we cannot conduct experiments that fully replicate core conditions, and our measurements are indirect, since no one wants to visit the core. That leaves us with computer models. Until recently, these models were rather limited. However, ever-increasing computational power is starting to reveal that the core has an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041018">interesting story to tell</a>.</p>
<h2>Onions not parfait</h2>
<p>Our planet, like all planets, is born of violence. The aggregation of mass during its growth came via large impacts and oceans of molten rock. Gravity provided a kind of filter: the heavy elements like iron were pulled to the core, while light elements like silicon and oxygen were left floating on the top.</p>
<p>That simple picture provides the basic stratification of the Earth, but it does not explain the magnetic field. To do that, you have to include convection, which drives currents of liquid iron that generate a magnetic field. Convection, however, requires a temperature difference between the center of the core and its outer boundary. But the heat conductivity of an iron core makes it difficult to imagine that the temperature difference was sufficient to get convection underway.</p>
<p>To muddy the liquid iron further, convection currents imply a certain amount of mixing. So, we have a few different processes at play: gravity drives stratification while convection mixes the layers. Then, as the elements mix, solubility and chemical reactions come into play. Was oxygen retained in the early core thanks to solubility and chemical reactions? Does the presence of oxygen change heat flow, which would then change the strength of the magnetic field?</p>
<p>To understand these processes, you have to perform a very difficult set of calculations. First, the quantum chemical properties of the elements need to be calculated to determine what the lowest energy configuration of a mixture is—how much oxygen should be in the iron. Then that calculation has to be combined with how the elements and molecules physically move around. All of these calculations have to be performed at temperatures of around 5,000K and pressures of 160GPa.</p>
<h2>Bring on the GPUs</h2>
<p>Twenty years ago, you could not combine these calculations in any useful way, because there simply wasn't enough computational power available. Ten years ago, these calculations were viable under limited circumstances. And now they can be applied at temperatures and pressures that are relevant to the Earth's core and with sufficient scale to be meaningful (though still very small-scale).</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, a group of researchers examined oxygen transport and retention by the core. The researchers showed that the early core probably had considerably more oxygen than the present-day core. However, that oxygen may have formed a stratified layer of oxide (though at these temperatures, it is probably better to think of this as a mixture of iron and oxygen) just below the boundary between the core and the mantel. The stratification and accompanying reactions reduces the amount of heat flow out of the core. This, in turn, weakens the convection currents that drive circulation required for forming the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
<p>In summary, these calculations make something that was already difficult to explain a little more difficult to explain.</p>
<p>The researchers note that, although the core of their results is reliable, some of the conclusions are tenuous. For instance, the partitioning of iron and oxygen containing iron is solid. However, the model does not have sufficient scale to determine if the stratification is stable when exposed to convection currents in the core and thermal gradients in the mantle above. These sorts of calculations require a different type of model.</p>
<p>The researchers also did not include the influence of silicon and magnesium in their calculations. These are the other two big elemental contributors and could significantly change the results. The researchers were treating their calculations as a proof-of-principle for the technique. The next step is to perform a new set of calculations that have a more realistic mix of elements. Then we might get a clearer picture of the chemistry of the early Earth's core.</p>

<p><em>World of Warcraft: Shadowlands</em> marks the eighth major expansion pack for the storied MMO. Judging from a half-hour playing it at BlizzCon this year, it seems like a natural evolution of modern <em>WoW</em> that will run alongside the very-different <em>WoW Classic</em> experience for the foreseeable future. That said, the biggest change wasn't part of my hands-on demo—but don't worry, that won't stop me from geeking out about it in extreme detail.</p>
<p>Let's be clear where I'm coming from, here: I've been playing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/world-of-warcraft/"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a> almost continuously for 15 years. (I lapsed for a big chunk of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/12/lich-king-review/"><em>Wrath of the Lich King</em></a> era for IRL reasons.) While I understand the appeal of <em>WoW Classic</em>, I am very much a proponent of modern <em>WoW</em>; the game has evolved over time to be more accessible for me to play just a couple of hours a week, as real life now dictates. But I tend to play solo or just with one or two friends on a sporadic basis, which means I'm looking for something very different than the hardcore raiding or PvP crowd.</p>
<p>Within that framing, I feel <em>WoW</em> has gotten more and more fun over the years. There have been some missteps, sure (I'm looking at you, <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>), but I felt that the semi-recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/world-of-warcraft-legion-review-youre-in-charge-now/"><em>Legion</em></a> was the best expansion Blizzard has ever done. My hopes are high for <em>Shadowlands</em>.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a sense of an entire <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion from 30 minutes of play. In my short demo, I recreated my main (a Beast Mastery Hunter) and played through the introductory quests from the Bastion zone, a heaven-like plane from Azeroth's afterlife. The minute-to-minute gameplay very much followed the formula of modern <em>WoW</em> questing, with a variety of tasks like challenging specific enemies to duels, helping craft things in timed minigames, and of course, killing 10 rats (well, not rats, but they might as well be).</p>
<p>From what I could tell, not much had changed about my character's build; my DPS rotation was the same as it is in <em>Battle for Azeroth</em>. But we're a year out from launch, and past expansions have taught us that plenty of that small stuff can and will change in the coming months.</p>
<p>As always, though, Blizzard really delivered on the art front. Bastion is striking, with big, beautiful skies, banners realistically waving in the wind, and fascinating characters, like a humanoid, owl-like race that inhabits the zone. Blizzard artists told me that they plan to support RTX raytracing, as well as new kinds of real-time lighting, in the expansion. I'm surprised by how good modern <em>WoW</em> looks on a high-end PC these days, given that it originally came out in 2004, and it looks like that work will continue.</p>
<p>Since this was an early questing experience and not an endgame one, I didn't get much sense of how Covenants—<em>Shadowlands'</em> new Order Hall, Garrison, or War Campaign-like systems—work. Neither did I have much time to dive into the story, though I saw enough to know that, if you like the flavor of the recent <em>WoW</em> expansions, you'll probably like this one, too. (I, for one, am glad we're going to get a brief respite from the Alliance vs. Horde war storyline.)</p>
<p>But the most interesting thing Blizzard is changing wasn't part of my demo.</p>
<h2>Taking it to a new (well, old) level</h2>
<p>Frankly, the aspect of <em>Shadowlands</em> I'm most excited about is an overhaul of the leveling system—something that wasn't a part of this demo in a major way. This kind of breaks the rules of a hands-on article, but I want to take an opportunity to talk about it and why I think it's interesting, regardless, since it came up in my interview with <em>WoW</em> developers.</p>
<p>After rumors about this possibility for the last several expansions, Blizzard has finally followed through on a level crunch. Whereas characters in the current <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> expansion cap out at level 120, the cap in <em>Shadowlands</em> will be 60—just as it was when the game first launched and just as it is in <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>. Level-120 characters will be scaled down to level 50 when <em>Shadowlands</em> launches.</p>
<p>That might seem odd or negative to those who aren't currently playing <em>WoW</em>, but it's actually something a great number of today's <em>WoW</em> players have been asking for. As the levels rose in this 15-year-old game that frankly wasn't designed with a 15-year plan in mind, Blizzard encountered all sorts of frustrating game design problems that players have been cranky about, too. The <em>WoW</em> team has already crunched player stats like health and mana down on multiple occasions as a way to postpone fully solving the problem, so this is the culmination of something that has been underway for a few years now.</p>
<p>And few things were more problematic from a design perspective than the experience of leveling a new character up from level one. A level-based MMO this late in life seemingly has had three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never raise the level cap, and try to entice players with other rewards besides linear power progression in the endgame. <em>WoW</em> opted not to go with this, though some other MMOs (like <em>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/elder-scrolls/">Elder Scrolls</a> Online</em>) have adopted it to varying degrees.</li>
<li>Keep raising the level cap with no changes to the leveling experience up to that point. This leads to ever-lengthening leveling ramps that make it extremely difficult for new players to get to current content. That's because each expansion adds another several dozen hours to how long it takes to get from the start to being able to play with friends in the endgame. (<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/final-fantasy/">Final Fantasy</a> XIV</em> has this problem to some degree, even though it's nowhere near as old as <em>WoW</em>.)</li>
<li>Keep raising the level cap but crunching how much experience is required per level as you do. This is the approach <em>WoW</em> has historically taken. But as this happens, levels start to seem meaningless. You gain them ultra-quickly, and only a smattering of them actually introduce new abilities or other perks. It also means that you blast through the leveling content at such a pace that you never finish individual zone stories; you only finish a small portion of an area before you have outleveled it and are ready to move on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blizzard's new solution in <em>Shadowlands</em> is to return the level cap to its original value of 60 and to make current content appropriate for levels 50 through 60. New players start at level one, and they all play through a new introductory zone built for <em>Shadowlands</em> based on the quest design lessons Blizzard has learned over the years. Once they play through that introductory experience, they can then level up to 50 to catch up with current content by playing through the previous expansion (<em>Battle for Azeroth</em>) right away (from around level 10).</p>
<p>This skips all the content before the previous expansion to give players the most modern experience from a quest design POV (and to make sure the players are connected with the current storylines). It also ensures new players have a shorter leveling ramp—Blizzard says it will be as much as 70% shorter than it is currently to get from level one to the cap.</p>
<p><em>Below: Shadowlands concept art.</em></p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">

                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>But it gets even more interesting when you look at how it will work for alts (second or later characters made by existing players). New characters made by existing players will have the option of leveling up the old way in all the same old zones from the start. But they will also be able to go through the new-player starting experience if that's what players prefer.</p>
<p>Further, once the new character has completed the starting zone, the player can then choose to level up to 50 in <em>any</em> previous expansion of their choice—vanilla/classic, <em>The Burning Crusade</em>, <em>Wrath of the Lich King</em>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2010/12/ars-reviews-wow-cataclysm/"><em>Cataclysm</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/kids-stuff-or-deep-gameplay-openforum-evaluates-mists-of-pandaria/"><em>Mists of Pandaria</em></a>, <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, or <em>Legion</em>. The expansion's content will scale perfectly with the character level, and each is tuned so that reaching level 50 involves playing through the content at a similar pace to a similar level of completion as those expansions offered when they were current content.</p>
<p>So, I could create a Mechagnome Hunter, play through whichever starting area I want, and then pick either <em>Mists of Pandaria</em> or <em>Legion</em> as my leveling expansion for that character. Once I finished leveling through that expansion, I'd be ready for current content.</p>
<p>Blizzard hasn't talked about what it plans to do after <em>Shadowlands</em>. I speculate that the longterm solution would be to do this every expansion—so in the next expansion, Blizzard might move <em>Battle for Azeroth</em> into the multitude of choices for new character-leveling experiences and push level-cap characters back down to 50 to start whatever expansion comes after <em>Shadowlands</em>—an odd hybrid of traditional MMO and a seasonal model common in plenty of modern multiplayer games.</p>
<p>The result is that leveling up new characters will be a lot more fun, and it will be easier than it has been in years for new players to pick up the game.</p>
<p>A new expansion is exciting, but <em>WoW</em>'s strength is arguably in its history—and revisiting that history is about to get a lot more fun. More than new zones, raids, or endgame-progressions systems, this is what has me excited to play <em>WoW</em> when <em>Shadowlands</em> launches late next year.</p>

<p>Lucy Gilliam has an infectious passion for environmental action. Today, she works in Brussels on environmental transport policy. But in the early 2000s, she was a molecular microbiologist in Hertfordshire. Like many in her field, Gilliam went through a lot of disposable plastics. It had become a normal part of 21st-century science, as everyday as coffee and overtime.</p>
<p>Gilliam was, in her words, a “super high user” of the sort of plastic, ultra-sterilized filter pipettes that could only be used once. Just as so many of us do in our domestic lives, she found she was working with what anti-pollution campaigners call a “produce, use, discard” model. The pipettes would pile up, and all that plastic waste just seemed wrong to her.</p>
<p>Science’s environmental impact had begun to worry her. It wasn’t just a matter of plastics. She also wanted to know why there weren’t solar panels on the roof of the new lab building, for example, and why flying to conferences was seen more as a perk than a problem. “I used to bitch about it over coffee all the time,” Gilliam tells me. “How can it be that we’re researching climate science, and people are flying all over the place? We should be a beacon.”</p>
<p>She tried to initiate recycling programs, with some success. She invited the suppliers in to discuss the issue and worked out ways the research teams could at least return the boxes pipettes came in for re-use, even if the pipettes themselves would still be used and discarded. It felt like a battle, though. Sensing that progress was likely to be slow, she started to ask herself where exactly she could make change happen, and moved to work in environmental policy.</p>
<p>The field of scientific research is one of the more hidden users of disposable plastics, with the biomedical sciences a particularly high-volume offender: plastic petri dishes, bottles of various shapes and sizes, several types of gloves, a dizzying array of pipettes and pipette tips, a horde of sample tubes and vials. They have all become an everyday part of scientific research. Most of us will never even see such equipment, but we all still rely on it. Without it, we wouldn’t have the knowledge, technologies, products, and medicines we all use. It is vital to 21st-century lives, but it is also extremely polluting.</p>
<p>In 2015, researchers at the University of Exeter weighed up their bioscience department’s annual plastic waste and extrapolated that biomedical and agricultural labs worldwide could be responsible for 5.5 million tonnes of lab plastic waste a year. To put that in context, they pointed out that it’s equal to 83% of the plastic recycled worldwide in 2012.</p>
<p>The problem with plastic is that it is so durable; it won’t decompose. We throw it in the rubbish, it stays there. It is thought that there may now be more Lego people on Earth than actual people, and these minifigs will outlive us all. When plastic products like these minifigs—or pipettes, bottles or drinking straws—do eventually break down, they stick around as small, almost invisible fragments called microplastics, which also come from cosmetics and clothing fibers. A 2017 study found microplastics in 81% of tap water samples globally. In the past few years, in mountain ranges in the USA and France, researchers even found microplastics in rain. They have recently been found in the Arctic, too.</p>
<p>Modern science has grown up with disposable plastics, but times are changing. This autumn, the first wave of young people to follow the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and go on “school strike for the climate” started undergraduate degrees. Universities can expect these young people to bring fresh and sometimes challenging questions about how scientific research is conducted. At the same time, many of those from Generation Z (those born from the mid-1990s onwards) are now starting PhDs, and millennials (born from the early 1980s) are leading more and more labs. As more universities challenge themselves to eradicate disposable plastics, as well as to go zero-carbon, in the next few years or decades, scientific waste is increasingly being put under the microscope.</p>

<p>In a sign of how far things have moved on since Gilliam left her career in research, last November the University of Leeds pledged to go single-use-plastic-free by 2023. Recently, UCL has announced it will follow suit, with the only slightly less ambitious target of 2024. These new policies won’t just banish disposable coffee cups from campus, but a lot of everyday scientific equipment, too.</p>
<p>Lucy Stuart, sustainability project officer at Leeds, says that the reaction among researchers has been mixed, but they are gradually making progress. “For us, as a university, we are here to inspire the next generation,” she says. “Also, we are a research-based institution that is creating groundbreaking innovation every day, so we didn’t want to say the solutions aren’t possible, because we are the people that help create those solutions.”</p>
<p>The ambitious target has helped focus everyone’s attention, as has the clear sign that it has support all the way through the institution from the top of university management down. However, “We don’t want to implement top-down policies,” Stuart emphasizes. “We want individual researchers and employees to take ownership and look at the problem within their area, and then make a change.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, many scientists are already pushing ahead on their own initiative. When David Kuntin, a biomedical researcher at the University of York, was discussing plastic waste with his lab mates, he soon found he wasn’t the only one who had noticed how much they were getting through.</p>
<p>“Using plastics on a daily basis—in science, it is kind of impossible to avoid nowadays. And someone just said, ‘Oh, we could fill a room after a week!’ and it got us discussing what we could do.”</p>
<p>One reason lab plastics are such a sticky problem is that they can get contaminated with the biological or chemical matter being researched; you can’t simply put them in the campus recycling bins with your coffee cup. Usually, lab waste plastics are bagged and autoclaved—an energy- and water-hungry sterilization process—before being sent to landfill. But, Kuntin says, not all plastic waste is too contaminated to recycle. Rather than simply classing everything as hazardous, straight off, he and his colleagues did an audit of the plastic they used to see what they could decontaminate.</p>
<p>“The contamination we deal with is probably less dangerous than a mouldy tin of beans you might have in your recycling after a few weeks,” Kuntin says. So, just as the team had learned that they had to wash their tins of beans before they put them in the council recycling bin, they learned ways to decontaminate their lab waste, too.</p>
<p>They developed a “decontamination station” with a 24-hour soak in a high-level disinfectant, followed by a rinse for chemical decontamination. They also looked at the plastics they were buying to pick ones that would be easier to recycle. As a result of these measures, they’ve reduced the plastic they were previously sending to landfill by about a tonne a year.</p>
<p>“That’s 20 workers, 20 of us,” he says, sounding as if he still doesn’t quite believe that so few researchers could pile up so much waste. “We used a tonne of plastic that we can recycle.” They worked out it was enough to fill 110 bathtubs. And because they have also cut down how much equipment has to be autoclaved, they are saving energy and water, too.</p>
<p>“I think as scientists, we need to be responsible about what we’re doing,” Kuntin tells me. Not least, he says, because it is public money they are spending. “You can’t, with a clean conscience, just be using a tonne of plastic.”</p>
<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>
<h2>More than a plastic puzzle</h2>
<p>At the University of Bristol, technicians Georgina Mortimer and Saranna Chipper-Keating have also set up schemes for sorting and recycling lab waste. “The waste in the lab was very easy for people to see. They were like, ‘I do this at home,’” says Mortimer.</p>
<p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/248_Plastics_Mosaic_Daniel_Stier_7_0.jpg"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">(credit: <em>© Daniel Stier at Twenty Twenty and Miren Marañón at East Photographic for Mosaic</em>)</p></div>They have been trialling glove and ice pack recycling through a company that specializes in hard-to-recycle waste, including contact lenses, crisp packets, and cigarette butts as well as the sorts of plastics that come out of labs. They are keen to think more about re-use and reduction, too, knowing that recycling can only take them so far. They have worked out how they can bulk-buy whenever possible to cut down on packaging waste, for example.</p>
<p>Plastics is only part of the sustainable lab puzzle for them. “We have a lot of ULT freezers, ultra-low temperature freezers,” Mortimer says. The freezers “have thousands, thousands of samples going back more than 20 years.” And they are all stored at minus 80ºC. Or at least they used to be. Anna Lewis, sustainable science manager at Bristol, showed them some research from the University of Colorado Boulder demonstrating that most samples can be safely stored at minus 70, saving up to a third of the energy. They have now raised the temperature of their ULT freezers.</p>
<p>The Bristol technicians have also been thinking about what they’re storing in these freezers, how, and whether it needs to be there. “There are samples that have just been left there for years,” says Mortimer. We’ve been discovering what these actually are, if they’re still usable, consolidating the space.” This hasn’t just saved energy and money, it has also made working with the freezers more manageable. It’s simply easier to find things.</p>
<p>Martin Farley held the first lab sustainability post in the UK, at the University of Edinburgh, back in 2013. He now specializes in ways research labs can become more sustainable, working in a similar role to Lewis at a couple of London universities. He first got into the issue because of plastics but quickly found a whole range of issues to work on.</p>
<p>Farley points out that these ULT freezers can use as much energy as a house. So if you’re worried about energy use in the houses in your street, you should be worried about it in the fridges in your university, too. Ultimately, as the climate emergency intensifies, Farley argues, “every facet of society needs to change.”</p>
<p>Labs might not be a “behemoth” like the oil and gas industry, he says, but they have a significant and often ignored environmental impact. In a research-intensive university, Farley reckons the labs will account for about two-thirds of the energy bill. If a university is looking for ways to reduce its energy use, research sciences are a good place to start.</p>
<p>“We have people recycling at home and doing nothing in their labs. I did a rough back-of-the-envelope calculation,” he tells me, and, depending on your research area, “your impact on the environment is 100–125 times more than at home.”</p>

<p>Tracing back through the history of science, it’s hard to tell exactly when disposable plastics arrived in labs. “That’s a job of work to be done, to figure out when plastic starts to get used in scientific instruments, scientific material culture, and how, and how it changes,” says Simon Werrett, a historian at UCL who specializes in the materials of science. He says that there’s plastic in a lot of historical scientific objects, but because museums don’t catalogue items in those terms, it’s hard to date it exactly. Still, he suspects science’s plastic problem followed everyone else’s.</p>
<p>Production of the thing we call plastic started in the late 19th century. Today, we’re increasingly used to seeing plastic as a threat to wildlife, but back then, if anything, synthetic products saved nature from being chewed up by human consumption. As the game of billiards became popular, manufacturers looked for a way to produce the balls from something more reliable than the trade in ivory. One firm launched a $10,000 competition to find an alternative material, which led to the patenting of celluloid (a mix of camphor and gun cotton) by American inventor John Wesley Hyatt in 1870.</p>
<p>Hyatt formed the Celluloid Manufacturing Company with his brother Isaiah and developed a process of “blow molding,” which allowed them to produce hollow tubes of celluloid, paving the way for mass production of cheap toys and ornaments. One of the advantages of celluloid was that it could be mixed with dyes, including mottled shades, allowing the Hyatts to produce not just artificial ivory but coral and tortoiseshell, too.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, the ever-expanding electrical industry was running low on shellac, a resin secreted by the female lac bug that could be used as an insulating material. Spotting a market, Leo Baekeland patented an artificial alternative in 1909, which he named Bakelite. This was marketed in the 1920s as “the material of a thousand uses,” soon joined by a host of new plastics throughout the 1930s and 1940s, too. Nylon, invented in 1935, offered a sort of synthetic silk, useful for parachutes and also stockings. Plexiglass was helpful in the burgeoning aviation industry. Wartime R&amp;D put rocket boosters on plastic innovation, and just as plastic products speedily started to fill up the postwar home, a plethora of plastic goods entered the postwar lab, too.</p>
<p>Werrett emphasizes that today’s problems are a product not just of plastics but of the emergence of cultures of disposability. We didn’t used to throw stuff away. Disposability pre-dates plastics slightly. Machines of the late industrial revolution, around the middle of the 19th century, made cloth and paper much easier to produce. At the same time, people were becoming more and more aware, and worried, about the existence of germs—for example, after John Snow identified the Broad Street water pump as the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854. Just as Joseph Lister pioneered the use of antiseptics in medicine from the 1860s onwards, disposable dressings gradually became the norm. “So you have things like cotton buds, and condoms and tampons, and sticking plasters,” Werrett explains, as well as paper napkins and paper cups. As mass production advanced, it soon became cheaper and easier to throw things away than to clean and re-use them—or pay someone else to.</p>
<p>Cloth- and paper-based disposable products arrived over a relatively short period, but the new throwaway culture they instigated paved the ground for the plastic problem we have today. Paper cups and straws soon became plastic ones, and the idea of “produce, use, discard” became normal.</p>
<p>Still, the introduction of disposable plastics in postwar science and medicine wasn’t necessarily simple. Looking at medical journals from the 1950s and 1960s, Werrett has found a few complaints.<div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/248_Plastics_Mosaic_Daniel_Stier_1.jpg"><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">(credit: <em>© Daniel Stier at Twenty Twenty and Miren Marañón at East Photographic for Mosaic</em>)</p></div></p>
<p>“There’s a tradition that surgeons have a pair of gloves, and they use that for their whole career,” he explains. These gloves would have been rubber—first introduced by William Stewart Halsted at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland in the 1890s—but designed to last, boiled for sterilization and repaired rather than disposed of in favor of a new pair. “By the end of their career, they’ve got repairs and stains,” Werrett says, “and that’s a sign or mark of your experience as a surgeon.” Then disposable gloves came in, and not everyone was happy to leave these marks of experience behind.</p>
<p>Nurses had to be taught to throw things away, rather than keep them, he notes. “It wasn’t self-evident that disposability was a valuable thing. If anything, the default is to re-use things. You have to train people to see disposability as a valuable practice.”</p>
<h2>Glassware is cool again</h2>
<p>For those looking for a plastic-free future for science, a technological fix could well be found in the history. Back in Bristol, Georgina Mortimer has been eyeing up the old glass cabinets. “We’re trying to get back into glassware, trying to make it cool again within our department,” she says, smiling.</p>
<p>In Brussels, Lucy Gilliam tells me about her grandmother, who worked in a hospital lab, and all the dishwashing assistance she had to support their use of glassware. “And now we do it all by ourselves. We’re like little research islands. And you know, plastic—and single-use disposable things—is filling the gap of people.</p>
<p>“There was a time when we were doing really advanced science without using plastics. And it’s not to say that all of the science that we do now can be done without plastics. But there is science that we were doing back then, and that we’re still doing now, that could be done without plastics.”</p>
<p>Plastic has become apparently indispensable for modern science. It can keep materials protected, even when we transport them. It keeps us out of them (for materials we don’t want to contaminate) and them out of us (for hazardous materials that might hurt us). It can be moulded into a range of shapes. Some areas of science—not least DNA research—have grown up in an era of disposable plastics.<div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img alt='Re-using glass has its own logistical additions, like repeat washing and sterilization.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/248_Plastics_Mosaic_Daniel_Stier_3_0.jpg" alt='Re-using glass has its own logistical additions, like repeat washing and sterilization.' ><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Re-using glass has its own logistical additions, like repeat washing and sterilization. (credit: <em>© Daniel Stier at Twenty Twenty and Miren Marañón at East Photographic for Mosaic</em>)</p></div></p>
<p>In some cases, though, a return to glass might be the answer. “Use glassware—it’s there, it’s available, it’s sterilized,” Mortimer enthuses. “All the universities will have a glass room just full to the ceilings of stuff that we can be using rather than plastics.” Along with Saranna Chipper-Keating, she has been tasked with producing a whole-life costing exercise on glass versus plastics. In theory, it should be cheaper to re-use glass than to buy plastics again and again, especially as there are often costs associated with dumping these plastics.</p>
<p>But re-using glass means it must be washed and sterilized, and that takes resources, too. This is a concern for Lucy Stuart in Leeds; they don’t want their plastic-free pledge to simply replace one environmental problem with another.</p>
<p>In York, David Kuntin is also concerned about the knock-on effects of switching back to glass. “Every day, we use reagents like cell culture media, a nutrient broth that cells thrive in,” he tells me. These broths have been developed for decades, and since most cells are grown on plastic, that’s what the reagents have been optimized for.</p>
<p>On top of this, researchers like Kuntin are interested in the finest details of cell behavior—and what they’re grown on could have an influence. “We know that cells are very responsive to their environment, and they can sense things like the roughness or stiffness of the surface they grow on,” he explains. Unexpected changes in behavior could be misinterpreted as a consequence of an experiment, when really it’s just that the cells are behaving differently on glass.</p>
<p>Another problem is how much time re-using glass could take. Disposable pipette tips are just quicker. And time, along with water and heat, could cost the lab money. Ultimately, though, they don’t know until they do a full analysis. “We could do a whole-life costing exercise, and it may well be that plastics are so much cheaper,” Anna Lewis says. “In which case, we would need subsidies.”</p>
<p>Lewis argues that any real change will require a change in how science is funded, with universities ideally needing to demonstrate some level of sustainability before they could apply for certain grant schemes. There is only so far they can go working with the goodwill and interest of a few enthusiasts. She sees scope to address this, if not in the next Research Excellence Framework (for assessing the quality of research in the UK) in 2021, then in the one after that. Whether the ecological crisis can wait for us to slowly negotiate yet another decade of science policy is another matter.</p>
<h2>"I want to do more"</h2>
<p>Martin Farley certainly sees a stronger appetite for change from the scientific community, compared to when he first started greening labs, back in 2013. “Five or six years ago, when I told my lab mates I was doing this, people laughed. There was a little bit of interest, like ‘Sure, I’ll recycle more,’ and some jokes. Now, I get emails on almost a weekly basis, people out of the blue that are saying, ‘How can I do something? I want to do more.’”</p>
<p>The University of Leeds is keen to link with other organizations, too. They’ve created a network around Leeds, including other universities, the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, the city council, and Yorkshire Water. They are also in discussions with one of the national research councils. Stuart says these sorts of collaborations are essential if they want to address disposable plastics on campus, because everything that comes in is part of the broader local economy. But it’s also part of the whole point of the project, seeing themselves as “a civic university,” ensuring that their research and innovation is used in a way that benefits the local area.</p>
<p>For researchers wanting to dive into the problem of plastic waste on their own, though, Gilliam has some simple advice: “First of all, see if you can get some buddies. Send out a note and convene a little meeting. Say, ‘I've seen these things, I’m concerned about it, does anybody have any ideas?’” In the event that no one will engage with you, she suggests you just start segregating some of your plastic anyway, putting it in a box and sending it back, sharing a photo on social media as you go. You might well find comrades in other labs if not your own.</p>
<p>“Start by doing something different, even if it feels like it’s really small and really pointless. Even small actions like that can have a ripple effect.”</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Residents of Jersey City, New Jersey, voted overwhelmingly in favor of strict short-term rental regulations on Tuesday, putting an end to the high-profile feud between Airbnb and local officials that had engulfed the city in recent months. The move comes as a major blow to <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/airbnb/">Airbnb</a>, which spent more than $4.2 million blanketing Jersey City in television ads, handouts, and pro-Airbnb canvassers in a campaign to quash the restrictions, which will affect a popular destination for guests looking to visit Manhattan (which is just across the Hudson River and several minutes away on public transit) without running afoul of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-new-york-city-reach-truce-on-home-sharing-data/">New York's tight rules on short-term rentals.</a></p>
<p>The new rules crack down on Jersey City’s booming short-term rental industry—which has grown by an order of magnitude since city officials effectively legalized the practice in 2015—by requiring that owners obtain permits and limiting who can rent out their spaces and for how long. Despite an aggressive opposition campaign, voters approved the regulations in a landslide, with current estimates suggesting nearly 70% voted in favor of the measure.</p>
<p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>Jersey City’s rejection of Airbnb suggests that the tide may be changing for the so-called tech unicorn, as the city joins the growing ranks of former Airbnb defenders turned defectors. Local government officials around the nation that had been early advocates of the company, from Arizona and Louisiana to Oregon, are now turning against it. And with Airbnb looking to do an IPO in 2020—a process that involves airing out its dirty laundry for investors—every bit of regulatory backlash counts.</p>
<p>Airbnb has spent much of the last decade fighting for legitimacy in cities around the nation, earning the startup an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-airbnbs-guerrilla-war-against-local-governments/">infamous reputation among many local officials</a> as a deep-pocketed agitator prone to litigation and public influence operations. The company has sued cities such as Boston, Miami Beach, Santa Monica, and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/27/airbnb-sues-san-francisco/">its hometown of San Francisco</a> over ordinances beefing up short-term rental regulations, and it has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-airbnbs-guerrilla-war-against-local-governments/">spent hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> hiring signature gatherers to help overturn local restrictions on both coasts.</p>
<p>However, over the years, the home-sharing giant began leaning more toward the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/airbnb-starts-play-nice-cities/">carrot </a>than to the stick. It has found success in many localities by partnering with local officials and agencies where each party ostensibly benefits. Airbnb began striking deals with city and state officials to collect and remit some difficult-to-collect taxes from hosts in 2014, with new rules legalizing home-sharing in the area often announced by local officials either simultaneously or shortly after.</p>
<p>Jersey City was one of the first to announce such a deal. In 2015, Mayor Steve Fulop entered into an agreement with Airbnb that was estimated to potentially earn the city up to $1 million in occupancy tax revenue a year. In exchange, Airbnb worked to get Jersey City officials to implement rules legalizing short-term rentals. Airbnb touted its work with Jersey City as an exemplary partnership, highlighting it at length in <a href="https://www.airbnbcitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/National_PublicPolicyTool-ChestReport-v3.pdf">PR materials concerning regulations</a> in the following years. At the time of the agreement, Jersey City officials lauded Airbnb and explicitly encouraged the use of the platform generally in statements issued at the time.</p>
<p>City officials now say that the legalization of short-term rentals was a grave mistake. When the deal was struck in 2015, there were around 300 active Airbnb listings in Jersey City. Within one year, that number had grown to roughly 2,000, according to an Airbnb press release from December 2016. At present, there are upward of 3,000 Airbnb listings in Jersey City, the majority of which are whole-home rentals—where the owner isn’t present during the guests’ stay—and are operated by hosts that run multiple properties, according to data from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/inside-jersey-city/">Inside Airbnb</a>, an independent site tracking the company. (Airbnb questioned the methods used to collect the data but did not provide WIRED with any evidence disputing the claims.)</p>
<p>Officials say that the boom converted precious housing stock into de facto hotels, resulting in higher rents, quality of life issues in neighborhoods plagued by transient occupants, and an exacerbated housing crisis. It’s a concern echoed by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-airbnbs-guerrilla-war-against-local-governments/">many cities</a>, as local government officials around the nation grapple with how best to handle the increasing popularity of short-term rental platforms like Airbnb, HomeAway, and VRBO in high-tourism areas.</p>
<p>In June 2019, the Jersey City council <a href="https://www.jerseycitynj.gov/UserFiles/Servers/Server_6189660/File/PRESS%20RELEASE%20-%20Working%20with%20Community%20Members,%20Business%20Owners%20and%20Local%20Realtors,%20Jersey%20City%20Proposes%20New%20Ordinance.pdf">introduced</a> a new ordinance aimed at remedying these issues. Starting in January 2020, rentals of a whole home or apartment where the owner isn’t present are capped at 60 days a year; renters are largely barred from listing their homes on platforms like Airbnb and HomeAway; and short-term rentals are banned in many multifamily buildings, among many other provisions. The ordinance passed, but Airbnb poured money into the city to gather resident signatures in opposition. Within 20 days of the ordinance’s passage, the company gathered more than 20,000 signatures, forcing a referendum.</p>
<p>“This administration is fighting to fix the quality of life issues our residents have had to endure over the years as Airbnb abuses their initial agreement with the city,” Mayor Fulop said in a statement. “We’re fighting to maintain affordable housing for those who need it most. We’re fighting to rid residential buildings of party hotels.”</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the vote Tuesday, Airbnb created a political action committee called Keep Our Homes, through which it spent some $4.2 million trying to convince the city’s 265,000-some residents to oppose the measure. Though it failed in this instance, Airbnb has used these tactics successfully before in cities like San Diego—which had to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-airbnbs-guerrilla-war-against-local-governments/">withdraw</a> short-term rental regulations in 2018, following a similarly high-profile signature gathering campaign led by Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms.</p>
<p>“Cities from Buffalo to San Francisco and Boston to Seattle have managed to pass comprehensive short-term rental regulations without punishing tenants or creating red tape and onerous registration systems,” said Airbnb spokesperson Christopher Nulty, without mentioning Airbnb’s initial opposition to San Francisco's and Boston’s regulations, which ended only after the company <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/technology/airbnb-san-francisco-settle-registration-lawsuit.html">settled the lawsuits</a> it filed against each city. “It’s unfortunate to see the hotel-backed special interests run a campaign that moves Jersey City in a different direction.”</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>It's Veterans Day weekend again, which means it's time for the return of <a href="https://t.co/H9PHnws79Q?amp=1">RunCode,</a> an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/codewarz-reloaded-programming-contest-ads-pwning-prizes-as-runcode/">annual capture-the-flag-style programming and information security competition</a> run by a non-profit group formed by a collection of volunteers (many of them with day jobs in the military) three years ago.</p>

<p>Originally a straight coding competition that supported multiple languages, RunCode evolved last year toward more of a security focus—though its challenges still involve writing code to overcome the puzzles. Points are accumulated with the completion of each challenge, based on its level of difficulty. Currently, the contest features 17 "easy," nine "intermediate," and three "hard" challenges. The tasks include challenges in networking, math, encryption, forensics, "pwning," reverse-engineering, and Web hacking, among others.</p>
<p>The prizes include a one-year subscription to the penetration testing training site <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/">Hack the Box</a>, a <a href="https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple">Wi-Fi Pineapple Nano</a> from Hak5, a<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/"> 4-gigabyte Raspberry Pi 4</a>, a RTL software-defined radio kit, and a WarCollar Industries DopeScope 2.0 Wi-Fi hunting tool (very useful for finding Wi-Fi hotspots and catching the "fox" during wireless challenges at hacker cons). Depending on participation, more prizes may be added, according to event organizers.</p>
<p>The contest started at 5pm Eastern on Friday, but it runs until 8am on November 11—so you still have some time to rack up points if you want something else to do with your time besides watching sports ball.</p>

<p>Theory of mind is the recognition that others have mental states, just as you do. It is the ability to put yourself in someone else's shoes, to acknowledge that their mental state—their beliefs, their perspectives, how their experiences have shaped them—differs from your own. And therefore that, when people act a certain way, they are responding not to an objective reality but to their own particular perceptions of that reality, which are likely not the same as yours.</p>
<p>False-belief understanding lies at the crux of this concept. It involves understanding when another person has a mistaken belief, and a prerequisite for that understanding is figuring out what the other person believes. And now there's some evidence that we're not the only species with it.</p>
<h2>Theory of mind</h2>
<p>Humans possess this theory of mind, along with its all-important false-belief understanding. But it is still an open question whether humans alone possess it. Our closest relatives, the great apes—bonobos, chimpanzees, and orangutans—have exhibited theory of mind in some experiments.</p>
<p>But it is possible that these other primates achieved this result by reading others' behaviors instead of their minds. Now, Josep Call, who studies great apes as a means to determine how cognition evolves, gave the animals something called "the goggles test" and concluded that yes, they do have false-belief understanding.</p>
<p>The key to the goggles test is that there are two types of goggles that look the same, but one is translucent and the other is opaque. Call used white barriers instead of goggles, but it's same idea. Half of the apes were shown the translucent barrier, and the other half the opaque one, so they could experience seeing through it (or not). Then all of the apes were shown a video in which an actor watched an object being hidden in a box, after which he "scuttled behind the barrier with legs visible below, to ensure that apes tracked his presence."</p>
<h2>Where does he think the object is?</h2>
<p>After the actor was behind the barrier, the object was moved to a second box and then removed from the scene altogether. When the actor came back, he reached ambiguously between the two boxes, and the apes' eye movements were tracked to assay their anticipation of where the actor would try to find the missing object. His reaching suggested that he held the false belief that the object was still there.</p>
<p>The apes who were exposed to the opaque barrier looked toward the first box where the object had been hidden. Since they couldn't see through the barrier, they assumed that the actor also couldn't—that he was responding not to where the object was, but to his false belief regarding its location. The apes who saw through the translucent barrier looked all over, assuming that the actor also saw through the barrier and recognized that the object had been removed. Similar results were seen in experiments done with 18-month-old humans.</p>
<p>This is not absolute proof that animals have theory of mind and false-belief understanding. Gaze readings are typically an averaging of a lot of complex behavior, and so need to be treated with caution. But at the very least, it suggests that other primates may use their own perceptions and recollections about the past, rather than an actor's behavior, to anticipate how that actor will act.</p>

<p>Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is checking in for a special weekend edition of our deals roundup, since several early Black Friday deals on tech gadgets and gear are currently available at retailers such as Best Buy and Amazon. The former says most of its sales will end on November 10—and you might need a "My Best Buy" account (which is free) for some of them—but that these prices match what we'll see on Black Friday proper. Either way, we've rounded up the highlights below.</p>
<p>Some of the standout deals here include new lows for a pair of excellent noise-cancelling headphones, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WH1000XM3-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Over-the-Ear-Headphones-with-Google-Assistant%2F931234733&amp;subid1=dealmaster110919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's WH-1000XM3,</a> and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBose-QuietComfort-35-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones-II-with-Google-Assistant%2F602445423&amp;subid1=dealmaster110919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bose's QuietComfort 35 II</a>, both of which normally cost $350 but are normally available for less than $280. We <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/12/our-favorite-and-least-favorite-tech-of-2018/2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prefer Sony's pair</a> out of the two, but both are just about class-leading when it comes to over-ear ANC headphones. Several Bose audio products are deeply discounted beyond that, including all-time low prices on its <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBose-SoundLink-Revolve-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-Black%2F589769498&amp;subid1=dealmaster110919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundLink Revolve</a> Bluetooth speaker and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBose-SoundSport-Wireless-Sports-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Black%2F156498444&amp;subid1=dealmaster110919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SoundSport Wireless</a> exercise earphones.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/guidemaster-the-best-keyboards-mice-and-more-for-your-gaming-pc/#h17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current favorite wired gaming mouse</a>, the <a href="https://amzn.to/2rqKV1W" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer DeathAdder Elite</a>, is down to a new low of $30, while <a href="https://amzn.to/2Cpoqwr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SanDisk's microSD Card for Nintendo Switch</a>—which we recommend in our <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/guidemaster-the-best-nintendo-switch-accessories-you-can-buy-in-2019/#h7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide to Nintendo Switch accessories</a>—is available for an all-time low of $20. There are plenty more noteworthy discounts beyond that—including deals on the Apple Watch Series 4, gaming laptops, Garmin watches, and external storage—so have a look through the list below and see if there's any holiday shopping you can get done early.</p>

<p>ANAHEIM, Calif.—This year's BlizzCon was a big one in many ways, but among them was the presence of playable demos for <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>World of Warcraft: Shadowlands</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em>. I attended the show this year and played all three.</p>
<p>While there was some tension in the media coverage and social conversation around this BlizzCon after the company's decision to temporarily suspend a pro <em>Hearthstone</em> player for making a political statement during an official stream, it was not the dominant mood on the ground. From the keynote through the community events, it was clear most people were a lot more concerned about the games than anything else.</p>
<p>And there were a <em>lot</em> of games. I've been to many a BlizzCon, but this was by far the most eventful in terms of announcements. There was the long-awaited <em>Diablo 4</em>, a new <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion called <em>Shadowlands</em>, a sequel-of-sorts to <em>Overwatch</em>, and a new <em>Hearthstone</em> mode that marks Blizzard's entry into the popular auto-battler genre.</p>
<p>I actually started my career as a writer writing for a <em>World of Warcraft</em> news site called WoW Insider (now titled Blizzard Watch). For years, though, I had mixed feelings about Blizzard games. I often felt like every Blizzard game had a more sophisticated, more compelling, more hardcore alternative. But as I grew older, and especially as I experienced games through the eyes of my then-girlfriend (now wife) who was new to gaming, I began to appreciate Blizzard's focus on accessibility, onboarding, and polish.</p>
<p>Based on how it's designed, it's much easier to keep up with <em>Diablo 3</em> if you work full time and have a family than it is to follow <em>Path of Exile</em>. The same goes for modern <em>World of Warcraft</em> compared to many other MMOs. Also, Blizzard games became a regularly shared activity between my wife and I over time. We leveled <em>WoW</em> characters together, each on our own desktops; we gathered <em>Diablo 3</em> sets in the couch co-op PS4 version; we formed <em>Overwatch</em> teams with my brother-in-law and secured many, many plays-of-the-game; we cheered for our favorite players in <em>Hearthstone</em> esports.</p>
<p>So I went to BlizzCon 2019 as a fan with deep, deep history in these games. And these are my (largely positive) impressions of arguably the biggest new game at the show: <em>Diablo 4</em>.</p>
<h2>Atmosphere and vibe</h2>
<p>Let's get this out of the way first: despite modern game design concepts and very modern rendering tech, <em>Diablo 4</em> looks a lot more like <em>Diablo 2</em> than it does <em>Diablo 3</em>. It's not cartoon-ish or colorful; it's dark, grim, muted, and painterly. If you're in the cadre of players who were disappointed by <em>Diablo 3</em>'s lighter, campier tone, you'll be pleased to see a return to form here.</p>
<p>Every asset in the area I played was created to convey a sense of decay, despair, and violence. And Blizzard has implemented cinematic transitions between areas. Instead of simply clicking on a dungeon entrance and teleporting to a starting point for that dungeon as in previous titles, your character will do something like get on their hands and knees to push vines aside and crawl through a cramped crawlspace, emerging on the other side. The game goes into a <em>Tomb Raider</em>-like cinematic camera view to depict these transitions, then it returns to the standard top-down view once the transition is complete.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bells and whistles like that intended to give the game a bit more gravity and counter the cartoony floaty-ness (for lack of a better term) of <em>Diablo 3</em>. We interviewed two members of the art team at the show, and they enthusiastically listed the major graphical improvements and engine features they've introduced this time around. For one thing, <em>Diablo 4</em> employs physically-based rendering. It also has environments with slopes and hills in a way that even <em>Diablo 3</em> didn't, and player characters seamlessly transition between animations in more realistic ways. (Prior iterations simply canceled the current animation when starting a new one, but <em>Diablo 4</em> follows a model represented by a lot of more modern triple-A games).</p>
<p>It all looks great, but as is usually the case with Blizzard titles, it's the art that really sells the experience. The technical stuff is in a supporting role.</p>

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>The look of <em>Diablo 4</em> was what struck me most about it, but it's also the hardest thing to convey in writing—so you'll just have to go off of screenshots, concept art, and videos.</p>
<h2>How it plays</h2>
<p>There's no question that it feels a bit like <em>Diablo 3</em> to play. Class skills have a similar cadence, similar effects, and fall into similar categories to those in <em>3</em>; which is a good thing, because <em>Diablo 3</em> feels great to play.</p>
<p>I played as a Druid—a class that shapeshifts at will. The left mouse button attacked in one form (a werewolf of sorts), the right mouse button in the other (a bear). In addition to that, there was an action bar of other abilities—standard Diablo stuff. Like <em>Diablo 3</em>, many abilities involve very clear movement like leaps or charges; it even brings the dodge mechanic over to the PC from the console version of <em>Diablo 3</em>.</p>
<p>It's tight and fast to play, but fundamentally, if you've played any other Diablo-like action RPG, you've played this one to some degree. It's worth noting that there are public events and that it phases players in around you at relevant moments similar to <em>Destiny</em> and its ilk. I fought one large world boss and participated in one random event—both were very similar to what you'd see in modern MMOs.</p>
<p>While the demo was too short for me to really sink my teeth into progression systems, I was able to confirm that it's something of a hybrid of <em>Diablo 3</em> and earlier titles. One panel has you picking between options for each ability slot, much like <em>Diablo 3</em>, but the other is a more oldschool talent tree with each point giving marginal advantages like +X% to the crit rating of some ability, or what have you. It seems like it should appeal to oldschool and newschool fans alike.</p>
<p>That said, it's very clear that this is an <em>early</em> demo. Reports indicated that Blizzard rebooted its work on <em>Diablo 4</em> back in 2016, and knowing the way the company normally works, having a playable demo only three years into this iteration is quite surprising. You'd be forgiven for suspecting Blizzard rushed to this point to alleviate fan anxiety over the lack of an announcement last year. Because it's clearly a demo pushed out for having-a-demo's sake, we can't be sure much of anything we saw here will stick all the way to launch two or more years from now.</p>
<p>But, what's here now is already fantastic—a perfect blend of <em>Diablo 2</em> and <em>Diablo 3</em> with modern nu-MMO (<em>Destiny</em>, <em>The Division</em>, <em>Path of Exile</em>) sensibilities.</p>
<h2>Improving on <em>Diablo 3</em></h2>
<p>When <em>Diablo 3</em> first launched, I played the campaign but stopped there. It just didn't grab me; the itemization seemed all out of whack, and the idea of repeating story chapters to grind for legendaries didn't appeal to me. However, all that changed with the launch of <em>Reaper of Souls</em>, and later, the console version. I began playing <em>Diablo 3</em> with my wife (then girlfriend) in co-op splitscreen (which Blizzard confirmed to be will also be a feature in the console versions of <em>Diablo 4</em>) for hours a week, and the redesigned endgame (including Adventure Mode, Greater Rifts, and all that good stuff) had us seriously hooked.</p>
<p>Between the two of us, we ended up building every class to max level, reaching embarrassingly high Greater Rift levels, and securing every set for every class. Ultimately, I played <em>Diablo</em><em> 3</em> more than I ever played <em>Diablo 2</em>. It became one of my favorite games of all time. But I didn't love everything about it.</p>
<p>For one, the game didn't have the same sense of atmosphere that <em>Diablo 2</em> did. For another, I felt the over-reliance on set-based builds made the endgame a little bland. Sure, seasons could mix it up a bit, but it really meant there was a relatively limited set of viable builds, as there were usually one or two set builds per class that were way better than the others for running rifts, and the majority of your equipment slots were unmovable since it was all about sets.</p>
<p>So does <em>Diablo 4</em> address both of those concerns? It seems like the answer to both is tentatively "yes."</p>
<p>While my demo time wasn't long enough to give me a real sense of what min-maxing in the endgame would be like, Blizzard designers said during <em>Diablo 4</em>'s BlizzCon panels that this game will de-emphasize sets in favor of legendaries to some degree. They also mentioned that there will be a ton of legendaries, but at a somewhat lower drop rate than modern <em>Diablo 3</em>. That said, legendary drop rates were too low at <em>Diablo 3</em>'s launch, but the game ended up being a legendary piñata with too-high drop rates later in its life. So it stands to reason that <em>Diablo 4</em> will evolve too.</p>
<p>As for atmosphere, as noted above, the game has that in spades—in fact, in this very early build, that right there is my main takeaway. It's dripping, oozing, soaking with weary, hazy, gothic, horrific atmosphere. In that respect, it borrows a great deal more from <em>Diablo 2</em> than it does from <em>Diablo 3</em>. And while I enjoyed <em>Diablo 3</em> more than some series die-hards, on that point I believe <em>Diablo 2</em> has more to offer, so this is a welcome development.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that my short time with <em>Diablo 4</em> made the game seem promising—but things are so early, it's hard to say much with certainty. Nevertheless, I'll be watching this one closely until it releases "Blizzard soon."</p>

<p>AUSTIN, Texas—Even for fans of experimental cinema, <em>Night Has Come</em>—a 56-minute black-and-white pandemic film made entirely of officially archived Belgian footage<em>—</em>may feel <em>quite </em>experimental. This is <em>not</em> a straightforward virus narrative along the lines of <em>28 Days Later</em>.</p>
<p>But around 2014, Peter Van Goethem found himself in a very relatable position: the PhD student at the Free University of Brussels had been working on a big doctoral project for two years, yet now he felt stuck. Van Goethem’s original proposal centered on documenting Brussels’ evolution over the years—its modernization, its rise on the International scene, its sociopolitcal changes throughout the great wars—and he had done <em>a lot</em> of research. Working with the Royal Belgian Film Archive Cinematek, Van Goethem perused <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17XvhuE846XKww4y1F2eS6NZDl1ORXbjH/view?usp=sharing">no fewer than 1,268 films</a> to assess various archival content spanning avantgarde experiments, journalistic productions, educational films, propaganda, prior documentaries, and more.</p>
<p>But something just didn’t work. And Van Goethem couldn’t shake one particular thought, something he repeatedly lingered on while poring through the archives.</p>
<p>“After two years of analyzing footage, it became clear I wanted to do something else with the footage. The archive felt like a gatekeeper—they decide whose memory we’re talking about, they choose the selection of items you can find in the catalog,” he told Ars this fall. “So I didn’t want to make a documentary about the city of Brussels anymore, because there isn’t one history—there are many histories. I needed another approach to the footage, a way that decontextualized things. An archive decides not just what’s remembered, but what’s missed. I wanted to make a movie that could reflect that, a movie about how we use footage of the past and how we look at it.”</p>
<p>It took another handful of years, some understanding academic advisors, and money beyond what Van Goethem’s original educational research grant encompassed. But the resulting work not only helped Van Goethem complete his doctoral work, it eventually turned him into a bonafide first-time filmmaker. That’s because, after failing to get his PhD project into some local festivals, Van Goethem received an email seemingly out of the blue from a little event called <a href="https://us1.campaign-archive.com/?u=af7f013bad7e785d15aab736f&amp;id=67351c3d63">Fantastic Fest</a>. And this fall he found himself some 5,000-plus miles away from home to witness the world premiere of <i>Night Has Come</i> at the biggest genre film event in the US.</p>
<h2>What’s going on here?</h2>
<p>The basic premise of <i>Night Has Come</i> reveals itself quite slowly, as an unnamed narrator begins by seemingly reflecting on his life while struggling to connect the pieces. An old man appears, so things seem fine—age has a funny way of making memory hazy, after all. But a lot of the images don’t look like the type of thing you’d want to remember: people fleeing a damaged city, some kind of dust slowly engulfing an empty landscape, chaotic movement depicted on a cellular level. On top of this, the narrator’s musings become increasingly peculiar early on. “Everything is going to be fine, I say to myself. I have to trust the treatment.”</p>
<p>“In Brussels, our city changed a lot during my PhD,” Van Goethem explains. “It became about militarization and control—you had those terrorist attacks in France a couple of years ago, and there was also an attack at the airport in Brussels. The state started implementing rules like requiring your ID or placing military tanks in the streets. So I used footage of the past to create a future that reflects our present-day society. I also wanted a metaphor for the archive, so the memory of the guy reflects the archive itself. History is not chronological, it’s our memory—uncertain and unpure in a way. I wanted to deal with those kind of issues.”</p>
<p>Throughout <i>Night Has Come</i>, Van Goethem’s ideas become clearer and clearer but never overt. Some kind of memory-wiping pandemic may be sweeping the country, and the governmental science community responds through quarantines and antidote development… or has the government been spreading this condition, leveraging it to control what the population does and doesn’t remember of recent not-so-rosy history? On top of all that, the old man simultaneously wrestles again and again with what his life might be if it's based on only partial memory. “The panic is that your life now consists solely of what you have forgotten,” he muses. The philosophical grappling of <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> meets the Big Brother concerns of <i>1984</i> and gets presented through a distinct art house lens.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-ejY5QDybg?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The film festival trailer for <em>Night Has Come.</em> </p></div>
<p>And make no mistake, <i>Night Has Come</i> definitely belongs wherever art house cinema gets housed today. When considering how <i>Night Has Come</i> came to be, Van Goethem’s creative exercise here seems downright daunting in its scope and miraculous in execution.</p>
<p>To start, think about how a film gets edited together—typically, a director has shot a finite amount of footage, all with intent behind the images and often with some larger sequences in mind. Van Goethem, by contrast, had an almost endless amount of raw material to work from. The only parameters around <i>Night Has Come</i> involved what he could and couldn’t secure the rights to use from the Belgian film archive.</p>
<p>“It involved a lot of trial and error, hundreds of cuts,” he tells Ars. “I had to really—I think for two years—edit, and it wasn’t going how I wanted. It’s like a brick puzzle—when one piece isn’t there, nothing works.”</p>
<p>Van Goethem worked with practically infinite puzzle pieces. Sometimes the themes and plot he imagined would drive his image selection; at other times some stunning visual would help direct where the filmmaker wanted the narration or plot to go next. And that’s merely the story and visuals; eventually Van Goethem needed to create a cohesive soundscape as well, since <i>Night Has Come</i> opted to eschew all original sound from the archival footage. “[Composer Guy Van Nueten] was trying to compose to what he was seeing, but I was always…'Sorry I can’t use that footage,'” Van Goethem adds. “You can make so many stories, there are so many hidden stories in the archive.”</p>
<p>Rightfully, then, this film repeatedly flexes its clever composition. A seemingly happy bit of archival footage may depict a couple walking in the woods toward a wind ensemble filling some scenic amphitheatre, but <i>Night Has Come</i> recontextualizes this visual to be downright sinister after Van Goethem has sequenced it among his archival finds and laid in an eerie soundtrack. Another memorable passage suggests that maybe this memory wiping ultimately does a society good—a sequence of intense, kinectic visuals of nothing but flashing entities (streets, cars, neon signs, a girl laughing as the camera zooms in uncomfortably close) plays out rapidly over a synth-y soundtrack that would make Trent Reznor proud. The freneticism of that whole thing makes it seem like life itself may be a disease in need of treatment for clarity. Van Goethem has somehow stitched together such disparate things—documentary footage of the city post-war, propaganda, seemingly random home videos of kids enjoying a lake—into a singular thought-provoking experiment, breathing new life into these archival bits that may have otherwise never even seen the light of day again.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sH2EXXpVEdA?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Composer Guy Van Nueten posted a scene from <em>Night Has Come</em> to showcase his electronic composition, and it happens to include one of the film's standout visual sequences (with all the various flashing images propulsively passing across the screen). </p></div>
<h2>One film fest begets others</h2>
<p>Van Goethem quickly points out that this passion project only became possible through a lot of generosity. His PhD advisors said yes to a crazy idea. A lot of heavyweights in the Belgian film world—actor Johan Leysen <i>(<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1440728/">The American</a></i> with George Clooney), writer Peter Verhelst, composer Van Nueten—donated their talents (some literally) because they liked the premise so much. He found inspiration in books he’d been reading (<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(Hardt_and_Negri_book)">Empire</a>, </em><em><a href="https://medium.com/@koertdebeuf/tribalization-d6446b5301ed">Tribalization</a></em>) and in the work of Chris Marker, who famously made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jetée">a short film out of old still photos</a> that eventually inspired <i>12 Monkeys</i>. And the film itself only saw the light of day because some genre diehards across the world so admired its ambition. <i>Night Has Come</i> hadn’t screened outside of a PhD jury before Fantastic Fest took a chance on programming it; Van Goethem has since booked his film at events like Gent Film Festival in Belgium and the International Festival for Documentary and Animated Film DOK Leipzig in Germany, one of Europe’s premiere documentary events.</p>
<p>So it may not have been easy and didn’t happen quickly, but this filmmaker certainly enjoys how his debut has worked out thus far. Van Goethem even hopes to make another film, though he’d advise against an entirely found-footage approach for the sanity of future filmmakers. For now, he’ll continue to take <i>Night Has Come</i> wherever he can to hopefully share his version of Belgian alternate history and provoke the same thought experiments for an audience that the Belgian inspired in him.</p>
<p>“It’s not easy to understand the movie when you see it the first time; you’ll leave with a lot of questions,” Van Goethem says. “It’s not always easy to tell what you’re looking at, but that’s the purpose. I didn’t want to give the answers; I wanted to raise questions. And if people see a different story, that’s OK to me… They would’ve never seen that footage—it’s just sitting in the archive. We need to rethink how we’re using this archived material and our history.”</p>
<p>Night Has Come <em>continues to play the film festival circuit. New screenings can be found through the Facebook page for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/IntiFilms1/posts/">Inti Films</a>.</em></p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Happy 50th birthday, <em>Sesame Street</em>. One of the most beloved American television series has changed a lot since premiering on November 9, 1969, but in fantastic news, one thing hasn't: its core mission of teaching children and instilling in them a love of learning.</p>
<p>Even today, <em>Sesame Street</em> remains the leader in this department. In a modern world of <em>Paw Patrol</em> and <em>Calliou</em>, TV series aimed at the toddler-and-preschool set can feel less educational and more like reasons for parents to light their hair on fire. Shows like <a href="https://disneynow.com/shows/doc-mcstuffins"><em>Doc McStuffins</em></a> and <a href="http://www.nickjr.com/wallykazam/">Wallykazam!</a> bring targeted lessons, but not to nearly as diverse an age group, and their singular focuses mean one is either focusing on literacy or science, not both.</p>
<p>There was nothing on television like <em>Sesame Street</em> when it premiered 50 years ago, and the truth is, there’s still nothing quite like it now. (That's a big reason why it was such <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/hbo-acquires-timed-exclusive-sesame-street-episodes-streaming-rights/">a valuable acquisition for HBO in 2015</a>.) Throughout the years, the show has always been on the front lines of what’s important to teach children. And as some of the show's greatest hits demonstrate, long before educational advocates began popularizing the STEM acronym (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/stem/">Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math</a>), <em>Sesame Street</em> was already there with silly characters promoting serious lessons.</p>
<h2>The Yip-Yips</h2>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTc3PsW5ghQ?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">The Yip-Yips discover a telephone </p></div>
<p>The “Yip-Yips,” a pair of blue and pink Martian explorers, were two of <em>Sesame Street</em>’s early characters. In their quest to figure out how things work, they would interact with different pieces of technology. Starting in 1971, they turned up to interact with devices children would need to learn how to use: telephones, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhKhGyUnc2E">clocks</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_trSIBCgF0">radios</a>, etc.</p>
<p>As technology moved on, the Yip-Yips began interacting with other devices, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCHKIdup5Lo">computers</a>. In the year 2000, <em>Sesame Street</em> aired <a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_3880">entire episodes</a> focused on getting children comfortable with home PCs, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d4RtvMQp10">the Yip-Yips were there</a> to help. As two of <em>Sesame Street</em>’s most memorable muppets (start yipping at someone between the ages of 25-50, they’ll hopefully know the reference immediately), that was only right.</p>
<h2>Pinball Number Count</h2>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JZshZp-cxKg?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Before you can add, you must count. The Count has been preaching this gospel for five decades, but the most effective counting short the series ever did was this one. This animated segment had 12 versions, celebrating the numbers one through 12. With a funky earworm sung by <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FBHR1YP/?tag=arstech20-20">The Pointer Sisters</a>, it was the kind of thing that a kid could easily remember long after the TV turned off, later singing to themselves even if they hadn’t put the song’s words and the concept of counting together quite yet. It’s so memorable, modern pop music references it, such as the riff line on Janelle Monae’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHgbzNHVg0c">Many Moons</a>.”</p>
<h2>Monsterpiece Theater</h2>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vftf8TTve4s?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Monsterpiece Theater: Twin Beaks </p></div>
<p>Around the same time as the Pinball segments, <em>Sesame Street</em> introduced “Monsterpiece Theater,” a spoof of the neighboring program <em>Masterpiece Theater</em> on PBS, which gained household name status back in the 1970s with the Emmy winning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstairs,_Downstairs_(1971_TV_series)"><em>Upstairs Downstairs</em></a>. The earliest clips were straight parodies of whatever was airing (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSOu5C55kUA">Me Claudius</a>”) or classic films (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQkL7RyJNzk">The 39 Stairs</a>”). But these soon became shorts about math, a slightly surprising turn considering the host was not the Count, but “Alistair Cookie.”</p>
<p>He introduced such fare as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSiVZ524yW4">1 Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QvpJTM4qYw">Hill Street Twos</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ7FV8HSSR0">Lethal Weapon 3</a>” (complete with that film series' stars), and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQNmq3jxL3c">Gone With The Wind</a>” (subtraction). Fans today know and love <em>Sesame Street</em> for recent parodies of prestige TV such as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhWUFXvaZjo">Game of Chairs</a>,” “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npcqBt_e4k0">Sharing Things,</a>” or the ever-popular “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-LfQCPJJkY">Star S’mores</a>,” all of which have millions of views on the official YouTube channel. “Monsterpiece Theater” is where the show got its start doing such work.</p>
<h2>“Put Down The Duckie”</h2>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/acBixR_JRuM?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Put Down The Duckie </p></div>
<p>How does one teach holistic concepts like cause and effect problem-solving and “if this, then that”? It's a hard concept for small kids to grasp, but the sooner they do, the easier it is to understand basic programming. It’s the part of STEM that doesn’t get mentioned in the acronym, but it’s probably one of the most important connections for kids to make.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult idea to teach in a three- to four-minute TV segment. <em>Sesame Street</em> not only figured it out, but the series did it with one of the show’s most memorable songs of the 1980s: the big-band Hoots The Owl-led song “Put Down The Duckie.” The chorus—“You gotta put down the duckie if you wanna play the saxophone”—isn’t just fun to sing, it’s an entire philosophy on reason that applies to many of life’s problems. It wound up being so popular that the show did a second, celebrity-heavy version for the 1988 “<a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Sesame_Street,_Special">Sesame Street Special</a>.” (Best part: the song still slaps all these years later.)</p>
<h2>Prairie Dawn, Scientist</h2>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZs5c0Jau4E?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Prairie Dawn explains air </p></div>
<p>In the 1990s, <em>Sesame Street</em> became more conscious of inherent biases built into the original program, particularly its lack of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-11-21-tv-59059-story.html">leading female muppets</a>. In response, it added the “<a href="https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19930524&amp;id=oWQPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lYcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5123,701745">Around the Corner</a>” set, introduced muppets like Zoe and Natasha, and produced segments where female muppets hosted explicitly STEM-angled concepts. For the latter, they brought in long-running character Prairie Dawn to host segments that were first called “<a href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Episode_3625">The Little Blonde Scientist Show</a>.” Thankfully, they were rechristened “Prairie Dawn, Scientist” in subsequent sketches.</p>
<p>Like many of the '90s and early '00s additions, these didn’t necessarily bring a new spark to the show. Instead, they fit in perfectly with what was already there, just with a female muppet as the central figure (one who had been with the program since the beginning, in fact). No fanfare, no fuss. It’s just another funny segment, and it doesn't make a big deal about the casual inclusion, so children watching wouldn’t think it remarkable, either.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Android has a bit of a malware problem. The open ecosystem's flexibility also makes it <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/imposter-fortnite-android-apps-already-spreading-malware/">relatively easy</a> for tainted apps to <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/12/never-ever-ever-download-android-apps-outside-google-play/">circulate on third-party app stores</a> or malicious websites. Worse still, malware-ridden apps <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-play-store-malware/">sneak into</a> the official Play Store with disappointing frequency. After grappling with the issue for a decade, Google is calling in some reinforcements.</p>
<p>This week, Google announced a partnership with three antivirus firms—ESET, Lookout, and Zimperium—to create an App Defense Alliance. All three companies have done extensive Android malware research over the years, and have existing relationships with Google to report problems they find. But now they'll use their scanning and threat detection tools to evaluate new Google Play submissions before the apps go live—with the goal of catching more malware before it hits the Play Store in the first place.</p>
<p>"On the malware side we haven’t really had a way to scale as much as we’ve wanted to scale," says Dave Kleidermacher, Google's vice president of Android security and privacy. "What the App Defense Alliance enables us to do is take the open ecosystem approach to the next level. We can share information not just ad hoc, but really integrate engines together at a digital level, so that we can have real-time response, expand the review of these apps, and apply that to making users more protected."</p>
<p><div class="image shortcode-img right full"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png"></div>It's not often that you hear someone at Google—a company of seemingly limitless size and scope—talk about trouble operating a program at the necessary scale.</p>
<p>Each antivirus vendor in the alliance offers a different approach to scanning app files called binaries for red flags. The companies are looking for anything from trojans, adware, and ransomware to banking malware or even phishing campaigns. ESET's engine uses a cloud-based repository of known malicious binaries along with pattern analysis and other signals to assess apps. Lookout has a trove of 80 million binaries and app telemetry that it uses to extrapolate potential malicious activity. And Zimperium uses a machine learning engine to build a profile of potentially bad behavior. As a commercial product, Zimperium's scanner works on the device itself for analysis and remediation rather than relying on the cloud. For Google, the company will essentially give a rapid yes or no on whether apps need to be individually examined for malware.</p>
<p>As Tony Anscombe, ESET's industry partnerships ambassador puts it, "Being part of a project like this with the Android team allows us to actually start protecting at the source. It’s much better than trying to clean up afterwards."</p>
<p>Setting up those systems to scan new Google Play submissions wasn't conceptually difficult—everything runs through a purpose-built application programming interface. The challenge was adapting the scanners to make sure they could handle the firehose of apps that will flow through for analysis—likely many thousands per day. ESET already integrates with Google's malware-removing <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2765944?co=GENIE.Platform=Desktop&amp;hl=en">Chrome Cleanup tool</a>, and has partnered with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/chronicle-backstory-network-intelligence-data/">Alphabet-owned cybersecurity company Chronicle</a>. But all of the App Defense Alliance member companies said the process to create the necessary infrastructure was extensive, and the early seeds of the alliance started more than two years ago.</p>
<p>"Google narrowed down the vendors that they wanted to engage with and everyone did a pretty elaborate proof of concept to see if there's any added benefit, and if we find more bad stuff together than either of us is able to independently," says Lookout CEO Jim Dolce. "We were sharing data over a period of a month—millions of binaries effectively. And the results were very positive."</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the alliance will actually catch significantly more malicious apps before they hit Google Play than the company was flagging on its own. Independent researchers have found that many Android antivirus services <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/android-antivirus-apps-bad-fake/">aren't particularly effective</a> at catching malware. And all of the alliance members emphasize that increasing Google Play's defense will only drive malware authors to get even more creative and aggressive about distributing tainted apps through other means. (Don't forget that these companies all have malware scanners they want to sell you.) But Google's Kleidermacher emphasizes that the company is confident that the alliance will make a real difference in protecting Android users.</p>
<p>"When you’re at the massive scale that we have in these platforms, when you can get even 1 percent incremental improvement it matters," he says.</p>
<p>More companies gaining access to Google Play submissions also raises the possibility that hackers could look for vulnerabilities in the Play Store pipeline itself. But Kleidermacher notes that Google has stringent contracts with all of its vendors that cover not only the analysis load they'll handle day to day, but how they'll secure data and use the special API.</p>
<p>"We have an agreement in place and there are expectations on us as providers," says Jon Paterson, Zimperium's chief technology officer.</p>
<p>While there are no guarantees that the program will make a dent in the Google Play malware problem, it seems worth a try given that app screening and monitoring are a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-app-store-malware-click-fraud/">challenge</a> for even the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/dod-app-store-does-this-one-crucial-thing-to-stay-secure/">most stringent</a> app stores, be it Google's or Apple's or dedicated government offerings. With 2.5 billion Android devices in the world—and a problem that it hasn't yet solved on its own—Google doesn't have much to lose in asking for a little help from its friends.</p>

<p>Michael Pratt, the principal owner of the GirlsDoPorn website, is already <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/feds-criminally-charge-girlsdoporn-owners-for-coercing-women/">facing criminal charges</a> for sex trafficking involving adult women. A new indictment, unsealed Thursday, has <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Owner-of-San-Diego-Porn-Website-Face-Child-Pornography-Charges-564629681.html">added child pornography charges</a>.</p>
<p>For years, Pratt has been recruiting young women to San Diego to shoot pornographic videos. Dozens of women say that Pratt and his colleagues lied to them and used physical coercion to induce them to participate—claims that led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/feds-criminally-charge-girlsdoporn-owners-for-coercing-women/">federal sex trafficking charges</a> last month.</p>

<p>Now prosecutors say that Pratt flew a 16-year-old girl to Southern California to have sex on camera. That would be a violation of federal laws against production of child pornography as well as sex trafficking of minors.</p>
<p>It's not clear if Pratt will ultimately stand trial for his alleged crimes. Pratt, a New Zealand native, reportedly <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/San-Diego-Porn-Website-Owners-Whereabouts-Unknown-560615211.html">left the United States</a> in September in the midst of a long-running civil trial that is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Criminal charges were filed against Pratt and three others in October. Two of Pratt's co-defendants are now in federal custody, while a third is out on bail. But Pratt is believed to be in New Zealand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/porn-site-owner-charged-with-child-sex-trafficking-amid-fraud-trial/">Courthouse News reports</a> that the new indictment was unsealed at "a hearing attended by Pratt’s co-defendants, GirlsDoPorn videographer Matthew Wolfe, actor Andre Garcia, and administrative assistant Valorie Moser." The judge entered a not guilty plea for the trio.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>One of the world’s most most technologically advanced hacking groups has a new backdoor that’s every bit as sophisticated as its creators.</p>
<p>Dubbed Titanium by the Kaspersky Lab security researchers who discovered it, the malware is the final payload delivered in a long and convoluted attack sequence. The attack chain uses a host of clever tricks to evade antivirus protection. Those tricks include encryption, mimicking of common device drivers and software, memory-only infections, and a series of droppers that execute the malicious code a multi-staged sequence. Yet another means of staying under the radar is hidden data delivered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganographically</a> in a PNG image.</p>
<p>Named after a password used to encrypt a malicious archive, Titanium was developed by Platinum, a so-called advanced persistent threat group that focuses hacks on the Asia-Pacific region, most likely on behalf of a nation.</p>
<p>“The Titanium APT has a very complicated infiltration scheme,” Kaspersky Lab researchers <a href="https://securelist.com/titanium-the-platinum-group-strikes-again/94961/">wrote in a post</a>. “It involves numerous steps and requires good coordination between all of them. In addition, none of the files in the file system can be detected as malicious due to the use of encryption and fileless technologies. One other feature that makes detection harder is the mimicking of well-known software.”</p>
<p>Titanium uses several different methods to initially infect its targets and spread from computer to computer. One is a local intranet that has already been compromised with malware. Another vector is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFX_(software)">SFX</a> archive containing a Windows installation task. A third is shellcode that gets injected into the winlogon.exe process (it’s still unknown how this happens). The end result is a stealthy and full-featured back door that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read any file from a file system and send it to an attacker-controlled server</li>
<li>Drop a file onto or delete it from the file system</li>
<li>Drop a file and run it</li>
<li>Run a command line and send execution results to the attacker’s control server</li>
<li>Update configuration parameters (except the AES encryption key)</li>
</ul>
<p>Platinum has been operating since at least 2009, according to a <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/2/2/5/225BFE3E-E1DE-4F5B-A77B-71200928D209/Platinum%20feature%20article%20-%20Targeted%20attacks%20in%20South%20and%20Southeast%20Asia%20April%202016.pdf">detailed report Microsoft published in 2016</a>. The group is primarily focused on the theft of sensitive intellectual property related to government interests. Platinum often relies on spear phishing and zero-day exploits.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Kaspersky Lab says it has yet to detect any current activity related to Titanium. It’s not clear if that’s because the malware isn’t in use or if it’s just too hard to detect infected computers.</p>

<p>Doctors in California found a throng of flatworm parasites overrunning a man’s innards—and they caught one of the little beasts on a horrifying video.</p>
<p>The case began innocently enough: a 40-year-old man arrived at an emergency room complaining of fatigue that had progressively gotten worse over a three-month period.</p>
<p>Doctors ran blood tests that determined the man was anemic. They also found that he had high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils, which usually indicate an infection or some other type of disease. Last, they noted elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, which can be a sign of liver trouble.</p>
<p>When the doctors took abdominal scans, they noted anomalies in the man’s bile ducts—the bodily piping that moves bile around and connects the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and small intestine.</p>
<p>Next in their investigation, they decided to perform an <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diagnostic-tests/endoscopic-retrograde-cholangiopancreatography">endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</a>, which is a diagnostic procedure that probes and visualizes problems in the ducts around the small intestines, gallbladder, and pancreas. In the procedure, doctors thread a long, flexible tube with a light source and camera down a patient’s throat, through the stomach, and into the small intestines. Through the tube, doctors inject dye to highlight the ducts on X-rays.</p>
<p>With the camera on, doctors immediately found the source of the problem: Large flatworms were seen spilling out of the bile duct into the small intestine. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm1903220?query=featured_secondary">They caught one on video</a> and reported it this week in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

<p>The doctors extracted some of the worms and identified them as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/fasciola/">the common liver fluke <em>Fasciola hepatica</em></a>. These are—as the name suggests—common flatworm parasites that typically infect domestic and wild ruminants, often sheep. The worms release eggs into the animals’ feces, which then hatch in freshwater environments and infect snails. After developing in their snail hosts for a while, free-swimming parasites break free and latch onto freshwater vegetation, such as watercress. If any unlucky ruminants or humans eat the infected plants, the cycle starts again with the parasites penetrating through the small intestines and invading duct work.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fasciola_LifeCycle_lg.jpg"><img alt='Liver fluke life cycle.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fasciola_LifeCycle_lg-300x241.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fasciola_LifeCycle_lg-640x515.jpg 2x" alt='Liver fluke life cycle.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fasciola_LifeCycle_lg.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Liver fluke life cycle.</a> (credit: CDC)</p></div>
<p>In the man’s case, he reported recently emigrating from Mexico, where he had worked on a farm and eaten watercress.</p>
<p>The doctors treated the man with a blood transfusion and the anti-parasitic drug triclabendazole, which is used specifically to treat liver flukes. Within a month, his symptoms resolved—though the horrifying video of his flukes will likely haunt others for the rest of time. (Of course, if you want to see more liver fluke action, there's another video<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4835282/bin/supp_188_7_524_v2_index.html"> here</a>)</p>
