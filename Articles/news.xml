<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is back with another round of deals to share. Today's deal is headlined by a <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-7pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 discount on the OnePlus 7 Pro</a>, a device we called the "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/oneplus-7-pro-review-the-fastest-best-designed-best-value-android-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fastest, best-designed, best-value Android phone</a>" on the market earlier this year.</p>
<p>The deal applies to unlocked models—which <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/unlocked-smartphones/oneplus-7-pro-unlocked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work on Verizon</a> and GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile—and brings the phone down to $549. OnePlus says this is their official Black Friday discount for the holiday season, and our own Android guru <a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/ronamadeo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ron Amadeo</a> told the Dealmaster it will likely go down as the "smartphone deal of the year."</p>
<p>You can read Ron's review from this past May for the full details, but the short take is that the OnePlus 7 Pro was already a good value at its standard going rate of $699. Despite being a large phone, it's been efficiently designed, with no notches or overly large borders blocking the the 6.67-inch 3120x1440 display. The in-display fingerprint reader and pop-up selfie camera only add to that efficiency, and both work well. That display supports a 90Hz refresh rate, too, which makes operating the device feel noticeably smoother across the board. The Snapdragon 855 processor, 8GB of RAM, and UFS 3.0 storage keep general performance as snappy as a top-of-the-line phone should. The triple-camera system on the back isn't the absolute best on the market, but it's still a great value for the price. And the "Oxygen OS" software remains a uniquely clean and useful take on Android.</p>
<p>OnePlus does make a few trade-offs to reach its relatively low price: there's no microSD slot, headphone jack, wireless charging, or always-on display support, and you won't get security updates as quickly as something like a Google Pixel phone. It's also worth noting that OnePlus recently launched a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/oneplus-7t-review-not-very-new-but-still-one-of-the-best-phones-you-can-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new phone called the OnePlus 7T</a>, which adds a marginally faster chipset and flatter display than the 7 Pro's slightly curved panel but includes a notch and a more pronounced camera module on the back. The 7T typically starts at $599 outright, but with the deal here, there's little reason to get it over the 7 Pro, which remains a genuine flagship phone at a mid-tier price.</p>
<p>If $549 is still too much, OnePlus is also offering last year's <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/oneplus-6t?from=6t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnePlus 6T for $449</a>, which is another $150 discount. Either way, OnePlus says these offers will last through December 2.</p>
<p>If you have no need for a new phone, though, we also have plenty more early Black Friday deals in today's roundup, including a ton of discounts on Anker charging gear, a Nintendo Switch bundle, holiday pricing for Sony's DualShock 4 controller, and much more. Have a look at the full rundown below.</p>

<p>Professional athletes at the highest level regularly contend not only with fierce competition from opposing teams or individual athletes but also intense psychological pressures, ranging from performance anxiety, fear of failure, and tensions resulting from miscommunication, particularly in team sports. Professional gamers competing in major esports competitions experience the same kinds of stressors, according to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336080393_Identifying_Stressors_and_Coping_Strategies_of_Elite_Esports_Competitors">a new psychology study</a> published in the International Journal of Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations.</p>
<p>Sports psychology has long been an active field, but applying it to esports is a relatively new area of research, one that the University of Chichester in the UK is embracing with its newly launched BA (Hons) esports degree. The program focuses on the scientific study of the physical and psychological impact of esports, including nutrition, coaching, and strategy in an immersive gaming environment, according to co-author Philip Birch, who specializes in sports and exercise performance psychology.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="https://www.chi.ac.uk/news/elite-esports-gamers-face-equivalent-psychological-pressure-pro-athletes-study-reveals">first study</a> of its kind, per Birch. The objective was to gain a clearer understanding not just of the stresses esports players face but also the coping strategies they use to deal with those stressors. Birch and his colleagues decided to focus on <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> (<em>CSGO</em>) because it is similar to physical team sports like football or rugby. It's a multiplayer first-person shooter game that pits two teams against each other: Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists. The Terrorists try to plant bombs or take hostages, for example, while the Counter-Terrorists strive to defuse those bombs and rescue any hostages, as both sides try to eliminate the other. Players who do well are rewarded after each round with in-game currency; those who screw up can incur penalties.</p>
<p>The winning team takes home the prize pool. Prize pools for <em>CSGO</em> competitions range from $75,000 to as much as $1 million. More than 380 million people watched esports competitions in 2018 alone, according to the authors, and it's becoming increasingly professionalized, including the formation of a trade union for players in 2015. As esports has grown into a nearly $1 billion enterprise, so has interest in exploring the psychological factors affecting game play.</p>
<p>In fact, in 2016, one <em>CSGO</em> elite team, Astralis, actually hired a sports psychologist to help its members cope with the psychological pressures of competing in such a high-stakes environment. Astralis went on to win the ELEAGUE Major in January 2017, and members credited the team psychologist with improving their ability to cope with the competitive pressures. The use of sports psychologists by esport teams is likely to become more common, and that means more research like that conducted at Chichester is needed to provide an evidence-based foundation.</p>

<p>"We thought [the study] was a good opportunity to see how esports players cope in front of live audiences and how they get along as a team," Birch told Ars. Many elite teams are more like families, often rooming together as well as training and competing in <em>CSGO</em> together. "Sometimes families get along really well, and sometimes they don't," he said. And unresolved tensions can potentially affect overall team performance.</p>
<p>Since this was the first study, laying the groundwork for future research, the researchers adopted more of a qualitative, rather than quantitative, approach. According to Birch, the qualitative nature of the study was better suited to an initial exploration of the various stress factors and coping mechanisms common to esports players. Future studies might opt for a more quantitative approach, although that would require many more participants.</p>
<p>The sample size is admittedly small, involving seven elite male players competing at the ESP Premiership <em>CSGO</em> Spring finals. The players had between two and six years' experience in competitive esports. Lead researcher Matt Smith attended an esports competition to better understand both the gameplay and the competitive environment, and he used that knowledge to develop the interview guide used in the study. Interviews were conducted by Skype within three weeks of the competition and were transcribed verbatim for later analysis.</p>
<p>Birch <em>et al</em>. concluded that esports players faced 51 different stress factors, most notably team communication problems and anxiety about competing in front of live audiences, akin to stage fright. Those are the same stressors typically experienced by professional sports athletes competing at the highest levels. Communication issues included players not listening, or not following instructions, or aggressively negative (often profane) verbal criticism from the in-game leader (IGL) during gameplay.</p>
<p>"His way of motivating players is to destroy them," one study participant said of an IGL in one of the milder examples. "He said to me, 'You are so stupid, and so dumb, and so incapable of doing anything that once you go into the real world you'll find it too difficult.'"</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/esports1.jpg"><img alt='Researchers found esports players faced 51 different stress factors—including worries about competing in front of live audiences.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/esports1-640x427.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/esports1.jpg 2x" alt='Researchers found esports players faced 51 different stress factors—including worries about competing in front of live audiences.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/esports1.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Researchers found esports players faced 51 different stress factors—including worries about competing in front of live audiences.</a> (credit: ESL/University of Chichester)</p></div>
<p>Other internal team issues included lack of confidence in one's teammates—especially in terms of maintaining emotional control under pressure—and being overly risk averse for fear of failing and letting down the team. Some players are more focused on besting their individual scores rather than increasing the team's performance as a whole, and tensions arose when some team members didn't take practice sessions seriously.</p>
<p>External stressors included trash talk from opposing teams, social media attacks, and the anxiety associated with playing a fast-paced, high-pressure game in front of a large live audience. "Like, you have whiffed, and you have no idea if the camera's on you, but in your head, they've just watched and it just makes you feel so much worse," one study participant admitted. Some participants reported feeling stressed over having to do media interviews—particularly players who speak English as a second language.</p>
<p>Birch <em>et al</em>. also identified several common coping strategies employed by esports athletes. These include techniques for managing emotional distress, like taking a break between maps, mentally blocking out the cameras, and trying to get into "the zone" so that one's sole focus is on the game. Other coping strategies were more oriented to solving problems, such as boosting a flagging teammate's confidence or having a group discussion after a competition to review what worked and what went wrong. Players may also practice so-called "avoidance coping," declining media interviews if they are press-shy, for instance, or staying off social media.</p>

<p>In addition to the study's small sample size, Birch <em>et al</em>. acknowledged another shortcoming: there were no female study participants. This was largely because the competition was heavily male dominated; the only women were on the hospitality and production teams. Female gamers are likely to face additional stressors; prior studies have shown that female gamers experience more sexual harassment, for example. The authors hope future research will remedy that omission.</p>
<p>The team would also like to look more closely at extra psychological stressors affecting in-game leaders. Additional studies might also explore how personality traits—like neuroticism, narcissism, and extraversion—can affect gamers' ability to cope in high-stress competitive environments. "We may be able to infer some predictions from their personality about how they're likely to respond to certain situations," said Birch. "And we'd love to get esports athletes to do some kind of training scenario where we try to improve their performance with things like breathing and relaxation techniques."</p>
<p>"As an industry, we've known for a long time that stressors on top-level players can negatively affect their performance," said ESL's chief operating officer, Rob Black, <a href="https://www.chi.ac.uk/news/elite-esports-gamers-face-equivalent-psychological-pressure-pro-athletes-study-reveals">in a statement</a>. “This study proves this and reinforces what we have been saying for years. Further developments are needed in this area, and that will be key in ensuring the number of professional players continues to grow worldwide.”</p>

<p>Swedish prosecutors have dropped a nine-year-old rape investigation into Julian Assange, saying that "the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question."</p>
<p>"I would like to emphasize that the injured party has submitted a credible and reliable version of events," Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson said, according to a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50473792">BBC report today</a>. "Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed; however, my overall assessment is that the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation."</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they interviewed seven witnesses before deciding to stop the investigation, according to the BBC.</p>
<p>"Memories fade for natural reasons," Persson also said, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/world/europe/sweden-julian-assange.html">according to The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>The large amount of media coverage of the case over the past nine years apparently also affected the decision. "You have to consider how much the witnesses will have read and heard from the media," Persson said.</p>
<h2>Assange in prison, faces other charges</h2>
<p>Two women made sexual-assault accusations against Assange, including a rape allegation, in August 2010. He was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19281492">granted asylum</a> in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012, allowing him to avoid extradition.</p>
<p>In April 2019, British police <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/04/british-police-arrest-julian-assange-on-behalf-of-the-us-government/">arrested Assange</a> after the Ecuadorian government invited the Metropolitan Police Service into the embassy to remove him. A British court later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/julian-assange-gets-50-weeks-for-jumping-bail/">sentenced</a> Assange to 50 weeks in prison for fleeing to the Ecuadorian embassy in London while on bail in 2012.</p>
<p>Assange also faces an indictment in the US that charges him with conspiring with Chelsea Manning to crack a hashed password belonging to a Pentagon computer in 2010. If convicted, he could spend <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/wikileaks-founder-charged-computer-hacking-conspiracy">up to five years in a US prison</a>. </p>
<p>The statute of limitations on sexual-assault allegations against Assange <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/clock-runs-out-on-some-sexual-assault-allegations-against-assange/">expired in 2015</a>, but the rape charge's statute of limitations doesn't expire until August 2020.</p>
<p>Sweden dropped the rape investigation once before, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/sweden-drops-rape-allegation-against-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange/">in 2017</a>, but didn't rule out the possibility of reopening the case. Swedish prosecutors reopened the rape investigation <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/swedish-authorities-re-open-rape-investigation-against-julian-assange/">in May 2019</a> and conducted interviews over the past few months before announcing today that there isn't enough evidence to pursue it further.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks, the document-publishing group that Assange founded, issued a statement after the Swedish prosecutor's announcement today.</p>
<p>"Let us now focus on the threat Mr. Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment," WikiLeaks Editor-in-Chief Kristinn Hrafnsson said, according to the BBC.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Networking-Blog/Windows-will-improve-user-privacy-with-DNS-over-HTTPS/ba-p/1014229">a post yesterday </a>to the Microsoft Tech Community blog, Microsoft Windows Core Networking team members Tommy Jensen, Ivan Pashov, and Gabriel Montenegro announced that Microsoft is planning to adopt support for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/04/how-to-keep-your-isps-nose-out-of-your-browser-history-with-encrypted-dns/">encrypted Domain Name System queries</a> in order to "close one of the last remaining plain-text domain name transmissions in common web traffic."</p>
<p>That support will first take the form of integration with DNS over HTTPS (DoH), a standard proposed by the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8484">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> and supported by Mozilla, Google, and Cloudflare, among others. "As a platform, Windows Core Networking seeks to enable users to use whatever protocols they need, so we’re open to having other options such as DNS over TLS (DoT) in the future," wrote Jensen, Pashov, and Montenegro. "For now, we're prioritizing DoH support as the most likely to provide immediate value to everyone. For example, DoH allows us to reuse our existing HTTPS infrastructure."</p>
<p>But Microsoft is being careful about how it deploys this compatibility given the current political fight over DoH being waged by Internet service providers concerned that they'll lose a lucrative source of customer behavior data.</p>
<p>ISPs give a number of reasons for their opposition to DoH. Since it prevents them from viewing plain-text DNS requests, it prevents filtering and blocking of some content—including, in the United Kingdom, the enforcement of content-filtering requirements placed on them by UK law. Because of its adoption of DoH as part of the Firefox Web browser, the UK's Internet Services Providers Association named Mozilla an "Internet Villain."</p>
<p>In the US, ISP lobbyists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/isps-lied-to-congress-to-spread-confusion-about-encrypted-dns-mozilla-says/">have pressed Congress to prevent Google from deploying DoH</a> on Chrome on antitrust grounds. Part of that lobbying is based on claims that Google would, as a letter from Comcast to members of Congress put it, "centraliz[e] a majority of worldwide DNS data with Google" and "give one provider control of Internet traffic routing and vast amounts of new data about consumers and competitors."</p>
<h2>Administrator’s choice</h2>
<p>According to the authors of the Microsoft post, the Windows implementation of DoH support will not change the status quo for corporate users or many ISP customers. "We will not be making any changes to which DNS server Windows was configured to use by the user or network," Jensen et al wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>…[W]e will look for opportunities to encrypt Windows DNS traffic without changing the configured DNS resolvers set by users and system administrators.</p>
<p>Today, users and admins decide what DNS server to use by picking the network they join or specifying the server directly; this milestone won’t change anything about that. Many people use ISP or public DNS content filtering to do things like block offensive websites. Silently changing the DNS servers trusted to do Windows resolutions could inadvertently bypass these controls and frustrate our users. We believe device administrators have the right to control where their DNS traffic goes.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Microsoft's implementation will also not "get in the way" of applications that use DoH or other encrypted DNS requests themselves. And it will have to provide for fallbacks when DoH requests fail. "DoH use will be enforced so that a server confirmed by Windows to support DoH will not be consulted via classic DNS," the Core Networking team members wrote. "If this preference for privacy over functionality causes any disruption in common Web scenarios, we’ll find out early."</p>
<p>All of this is for the future, however. Microsoft is announcing its intent now before making early versions of the capability available to Windows Insiders, because, as the three wrote, "With encrypted DNS gaining more attention, we felt it was important to make our intentions clear as early as possible. We don’t want our customers wondering if their trusted platform will adopt modern privacy standards or not."</p>
<p>It also seems that Microsoft is staking out a position friendly to ISPs—and to enterprises as well, where what might be hiding in encrypted DNS traffic from individual computers might be a security concern.</p>

          Patent images showing a potential PlayStation 5 controller design. Perspective view.                      [credit:
                        <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/d0200">Sony / Japanese patent office</a>
                        ]
                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>New images from a Japanese Sony patent, first filed in March and <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/d0200">recently published by the Japanese patent office</a>, seem to show a new version of Sony's DualShock controller. The patent images display some potential changes to the hardware for next year's planned release of the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony system architect Mark Cerny previously discussed the PlayStation 5's new controller <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/sony-confirms-the-playstation-5-is-coming-in-2020-reveals-new-hardware-details/">in an interview with Wired last month</a>. That interview mentioned that the new system's controller would sport a USB-C connector for charging and a potential wired data connection. And while the newly published patent images resemble the PS4's existing DualShock 4 in many ways, the port at the top appears to be USB-C rather than the USB-B micro connector on the DualShock 4.</p>
<p>There are a few other changes in the patent images that do not reflect potential controller changes Sony has publicly discussed. Chief among them is the apparent omission of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/sony-unveils-new-dualshock-3d-camera-for-playstation-4/">the DualShock 4's lightbar</a>. That lightbar's ability to glow in different colors was often used as a gimmick by game developers to indicate health or other in-game status effects, but it was also positioned in a way that was hard for players to use it or see it effectively. More importantly, many PlayStation VR games used that lightbar in conjunction with the PlayStation Eye camera <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/standard-dualshock-controller-will-work-with-all-playstation-vr-games/">to track the controller's position in space</a>, a function that would not be possible in the same form on the patented controller.</p>
<p>The patent images also show a small strip running along the bottom center of the controller, below the apparent location of the PlayStation button, including small holes in the front and rear of the controller. Wired's October story made specific mention of "a little hole" on the PS5 controller prototype being tested and raised the possibility that the hole could be an opening for a built-in microphone that might integrate with <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019183343&amp;tab=PCTBIBLIO">a recently patented "voice help system using artificial intelligence."</a></p>
<p><a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2019183343&amp;tab=PCTBIBLIO">The recently launched Stadia controller</a> has a similar built-in microphone for integration with the Google Assistant.</p>
<p>Cerny would only tell Wired "we'll talk more about it another time" regarding the microphone, with a Sony spokesperson adding, "We file patents on a regular basis, and like many companies, some of those patents end up in our products, and some don’t."</p>
<p>Sony has previously discussed other new features in the PS5 controller, including "adaptive triggers" that provide variable resistance based on in-game situations and more fine-grained haptic feedback that can provide distinct "rumble" profiles when walking across different in-game surfaces, for instance. That last feature was reportedly being considered for inclusion in the PS4 Pro controller but was delayed to avoid creating a "split experience" for PS4 users.</p>
<p>Sony first discussed the successor to the PS4 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">back in April</a>. That announcement stressed plans for high-speed SSD storage that will allow for faster loading times, a GPU capable of hardware-accelerated ray-tracing, and a "custom unit for 3D audio."</p>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6YFhORwXdA?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Video shot and edited by Justin Wolfson. <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mario_script.txt">Click here for transcript</a>. </p></div>
<p>There are over 7 million courses available in <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>. And at least seven of them are pretty fun.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, making a good Mario level is one of those tasks that's harder than it looks. So what differentiates a satisfying level from a frustrating one?</p>
<p>To find out, we reached out to both the <em>Mario Maker</em> and Nintendo Switch subreddits and asked readers to submit their favorite homemade levels for review. After sifting through pages and pages of submissions, we picked out a handful of interesting examples for a fuller evaluation by Corey Olcsvary of <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Nintendo_Treehouse">Nintendo's storied Treehouse product development division</a>.</p>
<p>In the above video, Olcsvary plays through the levels and gives his real-time assessments of what they did well or badly. It's a good sign, for example, when he says things like "when I've been failing I feel like it's my fault." A strong theme can make a level stand out—as with one example here that looks like the inside of a computer. Another course offers players a "sneak preview of... impending doom" via a quick trip through a clear pipe, a touch Olcsvary appreciated. Then there's the largely enemy-free, theme-park-inspired level that proves "you don't need to make a course difficult to make it fun."</p>
<p>Olcsvary also took us behind the scenes a bit, showing how the designers at Nintendo Treehouse used playtesting and feedback to refine a level that ended up <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwQh6oYH7mk">used in this year's Nintendo's World Championships</a>. That led to what might be his most important piece of advice: "Get someone to playtest [your level]. You might change it up based on their feedback."</p>
<p>Here are the course IDs for the levels shown in this video, if you want to try them out on your own copy of <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>:</p>

It could happen in as few as three years. (credit: SpaceX)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>About a year ago, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/nasa-takes-a-tangible-step-back-toward-the-moon-with-commercial-program/">NASA announced</a> it had selected nine different companies that were eligible to compete for contracts to deliver relatively small science and cargo missions to the lunar surface.</p>
<p>What seemed notable about this was that many of the companies selected had not done much (if any) business with NASA before. (Lockheed Martin was an exception.) NASA has since begun to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/nasa-picks-three-companies-to-attempt-moon-landings-in-2020-and-2021/">award a couple</a> of contracts for actual deliveries, but it evidently wants more bidders. So on Monday, the agency added <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-companies-join-growing-ranks-of-nasa-partners-for-artemis-program">five new companies</a> to the pool of eligible contractors in its Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, or CLPS.</p>
<p>“Expanding the group of companies who are eligible to bid on sending payloads to the Moon’s surface drives innovation and reduces costs to NASA and American taxpayers," the agency's administrator, Jim Bridenstine, said <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/new-companies-join-growing-ranks-of-nasa-partners-for-artemis-program">in a news release</a>.</p>
<p>This group contained more surprises, such as little-known, California-based Ceres Robotics, which is developing <a href="https://www.ceresrobotics.com/rovers">small rovers</a> that could explore the surface of the Moon and counts Buzz Aldrin's son Andy among its advisers.</p>

<p>Prominent new space companies Blue Origin and SpaceX were also among those selected. Blue Origin was no surprise, as it bid its New Glenn rocket and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/jeff-bezos-unveils-his-sweeping-vision-for-humanitys-future-in-space/">Blue Moon lander</a>, capable of delivering more than 3 tons to the lunar surface.</p>
<p>SpaceX offered NASA the use of its Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket. This is a bit of overkill for what NASA seeks with its modest CLPS program, as theoretically Starship could one day deliver as much as 100 tons to the lunar surface. But it does offer SpaceX some validation that if it fully develops the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2019/09/after-starship-unveiling-mars-seems-a-little-closer/">ambitious Starship vehicle</a>, NASA will be a willing customer in the future. This may, in turn, help SpaceX raise development funds from investors.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">"This is a super cool program," SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said of CLPS in a call with reporters on Monday. "It is an avenue for us to deliver payloads to the surface of the Moon for a customer. Obviously we’re thrilled that NASA is a potential customer for us with that vehicle. CLPS is a great piece of what we want to get done with Starship." She added that SpaceX is aiming to be able to land Starship on the lunar surface by 2022.</span></p>

<p>Over the coming years, NASA will ask this pool of bidders for proposals to deliver rovers, power sources, and science experiments, including the agency’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover, to various locations on the Moon. The CLPS contracts have a combined maximum value of $2.6 billion through November 2028 and will be awarded based on technical feasibility, price, and schedule.</p>
<p>By supporting a range of new and established providers and pushing the frontier of commercial space to the Moon, NASA seems keen to support innovative US aerospace companies. By going with some not entirely proven companies, NASA's lunar program also appears to be willing to fail from time to time for the sake of advancement.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">"As NASA continues to lean forward and use commercial services to explore the Moon, we want as many diverse ideas as we can on the table," said Steve Clarke, deputy associate administrator for exploration in NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, during the media call. "We are really on the precipice here of seeing the commercial services that can expand and flourish, with not just NASA as a customer."</span></p>

<p>Until recently, weaknesses in Android camera apps from Google and Samsung made it possible for rogue apps to record video and audio and take images and then upload them to an attacker-controlled server—without any permissions to do so. Camera apps from other manufacturers may still be susceptible.</p>
<p>The weakness, which was discovered by researchers from security firm Checkmarx, represented a potential privacy risk to high-value targets, such as those preyed upon by nation-sponsored spies. Google carefully designed its Android operating system to bar apps from accessing cameras and microphones without explicit permission from end users. An <a href="https://www.checkmarx.com/blog/how-attackers-could-hijack-your-android-camera">investigation published Tuesday</a> showed it was trivial to bypass those restrictions. The investigation found that an app needed no permissions at all to cause the camera to shoot pictures and record video and audio. To upload the images and video—or any other image and video stored on the phone—to an attacker-controlled server, an app needed only permission to access storage, which is among one of the most commonly given usage rights.</p>
<p>The weakness, which is tracked as CVE-2019-2234, also allowed would-be attackers to track the physical location of the device, assuming GPS data was embedded into images or videos. Google closed the eavesdropping hole in its Pixel line of devices with a camera update that became available in July. Checkmarx said Samsung has also fixed the vulnerability, although it wasn't clear when that happened. Checkmarx said Google has indicated that Android phones from other manufacturers may also be vulnerable. The specific makers and models haven't been disclosed.</p>
<p>"The ability for an application to retrieve input from the camera, microphone, and GPS location is considered highly invasive by Google themselves," Checkmarx Director of Security Research Erez Yalon wrote in Tuesday's analysis. "As a result, <a href="https://source.android.com/">AOSP</a> created a specific set of <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config">permissions</a> that an application must request from the user."</p>
<p>To demonstrate the risk, Checkmarx developed a proof-of-concept rogue app that exploited the weakness. It masqueraded as a simple weather app. Hidden inside were functions that could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take pictures and record videos, even when the phone was locked, the screen was off, or the app was closed</li>
<li>Pull GPS data embedded into any photo or video stored on the phone</li>
<li>Eavesdrop and record two-way phone conversations and simultaneously record video or take images</li>
<li>Silence the camera shutter to make the spying harder to detect</li>
<li>Transfer any photo or video stored on the phone to an attacker-controlled server</li>
<li>List and download any JPG image or MP4 video stored on the phone's SD card</li>
</ul>
<p>An attack wouldn't be completely surreptitious. The screen of an exploited device would display the camera as it recorded video or shot an image. That would tip off anyone who was looking at the handset at the time the attack was being carried out. Still, the attack would be able to capture video, sound, and images at times when a phone display was out of eyesight, such as when the device was placed screen down. The app was able to use the proximity sensor to determine when the device is face down.</p>
<p>Checkmarx's PoC app was also able to use a phone's proximity sensor to detect when it was held to a target's ear, as often happens during phone calls. The app was able to record both sides of the conversation. It could also record video or take images, a useful capability in the event the back of the phone was facing a whiteboard or something else of interest to an attacker. Checkmarx's report includes a video demonstrating the capabilities of the PoC app.</p>
<p>In a statement, Google officials wrote: "We appreciate Checkmarx bringing this to our attention and working with Google and Android partners to coordinate disclosure. The issue was addressed on impacted Google devices via a Play Store update to the Google Camera Application in July 2019. A patch has also been made available to all partners."</p>
<p>Samsung officials wrote: "Since being notified of this issue by Google, we have subsequently released patches to address all Samsung device models that may be affected. We value our partnership with the Android team that allowed us to identify and address this matter directly."</p>
<p>The statement didn't say when Samsung released the fix or how Samsung customers can check if the patch has been installed.</p>
<p>Checkmarx said Google has privately indicated that other makers of Android phones besides Samsung may also be vulnerable. Google's statement didn't directly confirm this or say if any other manufacturers have installed an update.</p>
<p>In an email, Checkmarx's Yalon said it wasn't clear why apps could access the camera without the user providing permission. He speculated that the weakness may be the result of Google making the camera work with the voice-activated Google Assistant and other manufacturers following suit.</p>
<p>Users of Pixel phones can confirm they aren't vulnerable by accessing Apps and Notifications from the settings menu, choosing Camera &gt; Advanced &gt; and App details. The screen should show that the app has been updated since July (and ideally much more recently than that).</p>
<p>Checking if other Android phones are susceptible will be difficult for most users. Those who are more technically skilled can run the following command:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$ adb shell am start-activity -n<br />
com.google.android.GoogleCamera/com.android.camera.CameraActivity --ez<br />
extra_turn_screen_on true -a android.media.action.VIDEO_CAMERA --ez<br />
android.intent.extra.USE_FRONT_CAMERA true</code></p></blockquote>
<p>The above command will force the phone to take video. The following command will force the phone to take a photo:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$ adb shell am start-activity -n<br />
com.google.android.GoogleCamera/com.android.camera.CameraActivity --ez<br />
extra_turn_screen_on true -a android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA -<br />
-ez android.intent.extra.USE_FRONT_CAMERA true --ei<br />
android.intent.extra.TIMER_DURATION_SECONDS 3</code></p></blockquote>
<p>The skill and luck required to make the attack work reliably and without detection are high enough that this type of exploit isn't likely to be used against the vast majority of Android users. Still, the ease of sneaking malicious apps into the Google Play store suggests it wouldn't be hard for a determined and sophisticated attacker to pull off something like this. No wonder phones and other electronics are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/republicans-storm-ultra-secure-scif-some-with-cellphones-blazing/">barred from SCIFs</a> and other sensitive environments.</p>

<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Emu0I2hNfUk?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Hugh Laurie stars as Captain Ryan Clark in <em>Avenue 5</em>, a new comedy series from HBO. </p></div>
<p>Passengers and crew aboard a luxury spaceship find themselves in grave danger in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_5_(TV_series)">Avenue 5</a></em>, the new "space tourism" comedy series from HBO. Judging by the first teaser, the show looks like it could be a sharp, witty addition to the cable giant's slate of programming.</p>
<p>Clearly there's an appetite for space-based comedy in Hollywood these days, as Netflix teased its own comedy series, <em>Space Force</em>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/steve-carell-office-vets-are-making-space-force-a-netflix-comedy-series/">earlier this year</a>, with three major vets of TV's <em>The Office</em> on board, including Steve Carell as both a co-creator and a star. Netflix has yet to release many details about the series. All we know is that "The goal of the new branch is 'to defend satellites from attack' and 'perform other space-related tasks'... or something," per the <em>Space Force</em> teaser text. "This is the story of the men and women who have to figure it out."</p>
<p>We don't know much more about <em>Avenue 5</em>, but it also boasts some serious comedic chops. The series is the brainchild of Armando Iannucci, best known for creating the stellar HBO comedy series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veep"><em>Veep</em></a>, which won multiple Emmy awards over its seven-season run. And before he was Dr. Gregory House in the US, Laurie was best known across the pond for yukking it up as one-half of the comedy duo in <em>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</em> (with Stephen Fry), as well as his hilarious turns in <em>Jeeves and Wooster</em> and the various <em>Blackadder</em> series.</p>

<p><em>Avenue 5</em> is set roughly 40 years in the future, when private spaceflight, aka space tourism, is totally a thing. The titular space cruise chip is modeled after today's luxury ocean liners, complete with fine dining and regular exercise classes. But then the ship experiences major technical difficulties, putting everyone aboard at risk, while the crew scrambles to solve the problem while keeping the passengers from panicking.</p>
<p>In addition to Laurie, the cast includes <em>Silicon Valley</em>'s Zach Woods as Matt Spencer, head of customer relations—who does a very bad job reassuring passengers when the trouble starts. "This is a safe space," he says. "Emotionally. Physically we're obviously in terrible danger." Josh Gad (<em>Frozen 2</em>) plays smarmy billionaire Herman Judd, who owns the <em>Avenue 5</em> and pretends to be a man of the people, when he's frankly quite the snob.</p>
<p>Making Captain Ryan's job even more difficult is Karen Kelly (Rebecca Front), a bossy passenger who apparently is on board <a href="https://deadline.com/video/avenue-5-teaser-first-look-armando-iannuccis-hbo-space-comedy-series-hugh-laurie/">under false pretenses</a>, having used her sister's (nontransferable) ticket. Rounding out the cast are Suzy Nakamura as Iris Kimura, an associate owner of the ship; Lenora Crichlow as second engineer Billie McEvoy; Himesh Patel (<em>Yesterday</em>) as stand-up comedian Jordan Hatwal, performing on the <em>Avenue 5</em>; and Ethan Phillips as former astronaut Spike Williams, whose boozy womanizing ways are bound to cause tensions.</p>
<p><em>Avenue 5</em> is coming to HBO in January 2020.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>For a certain class of video game fan, no news could be bigger than today's: <em>Half-Life</em> is back. In VR. As an entirely new game from the series' creators at Valve.</p>
<p>We're here to connect the dots between what has been <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">announced</a>, what has been rumored, and what we've heard from well-placed sources. Rise and shine, <em>Half-Life</em> fans. We have a lot for you today.</p>
<h2>Months of rumors, then a TGA leak</h2>
<p>We should probably begin with the game's name, as revealed in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">a leaked Game Awards 2019 presentation</a> and confirmed hours later by <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">an official post from Valve</a>. <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is a brand-new game in the <em>Half-Life</em> universe designed exclusively for PC virtual reality systems (Valve Index, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Windows Mixed Reality).</p>
<p>This is, in fact, the oft-teased "VR game" mentioned by Valve over the past few years and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/valve-index-reveal-the-best-of-vrs-first-generation-but-is-it-worth-999/">the one we had been told to expect by the end of 2019</a>. Today's leak includes a revised release window of March 2020, which our sources indicate is likely—but also subject to change due to the phenomenon that fans call "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">Valve Time</a>."</p>
<p>Today's announcement has confirmed a hard truth: Valve's game development teams still cannot count to three. In <em>HLA</em>'s case, it's because this is a prequel, not a sequel. And it's a full single-player campaign of brand-new VR content, though our sources can't confirm how long the game will actually take to beat.</p>
<p>The game's name confirms what has been loudly rumored for months: that you will play this game from the perspective of Alyx Vance, a character introduced in 2004's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2004/12/hl2/"><em>Half-Life 2</em></a>. Instead of stepping forward in time, <em>HLA</em> will rewind to the period between the first two mainline <em>Half-Life</em> games.</p>
<p>For those who have lost track of the series' timeline, the original 1998 game saw the Black Mesa research institute loose an alien race (the Combine) onto our planet. The sequel picked up an uncertain number of years later, with a network of researchers and resistance fighters working to take out the Combine's invasion and domination of Earth, in spite of a human-fronted organization that capitulated to the Combine's control.</p>
<p>Both of those games starred Gordon Freeman as a silent protagonist. This new VR game mixes things up by putting you in Alyx's shoes, years before the events of <em>HL2</em> and before Freeman's return to the series' universe. (This won't be the first time an official <em>HL</em> game wrested control from Freeman; the 2001 expansion pack <em>Half-Life: Blue Shift</em> starred the first game's beloved security guard Barney.) We've gotten an indication that the game's testing period hasn't shown any parts of Alyx's body in place of your own, beyond a pair of hands. But that could very well change.</p>
<h2>Grabbity Gloves?</h2>
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em> was arguably the gaming world's first major "physics adventure," since it revolved around a clever Gravity Gun system that let you pull and toss all manner of items big and small. We've gotten some indication that <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> follows suit.</p>
<p>A data leak from Valve's Source 2 game engine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB8LsrgOeBU">as uncovered in September by Valve News Network</a>, pointed to a new control system labeled as the "Grabbity Gloves" in its code base. Multiple sources have confirmed that this is indeed a major control system in <em>HLA</em>.</p>
<p>How do they work? We've gotten hints that they might more accurately be described as "Magnet Gloves," in that they let players magically point to and attract distant items to your hands. Instead of having to walk all the way to an object in VR or bend over to grab something from the floor, <em>HLA</em> players will have a handy point-and-snag system. And we're told that these are spiritual successors to <em>HL2</em>'s Gravity Gun, in terms of revolving around realistic physics. Maybe that means we can, or cannot, grab certain items due to real-life physics systems or obstacles.</p>
<p>However this system works, it seems to both favor the newer Valve Index controllers (which strap to users' knuckles and leave fingers free to move around) and offer concessions to older controllers like the HTC Vive wands. Valve has already announced plans to support all major VR PC systems for its next VR game, and these new gloves seem like the right system to scale to whatever controllers you bring into VR.</p>
<p>But we also get the sense that <em>HLA</em> is a serious showcase for Valve Index's "Knuckles" controllers. We hear that most every object in the game's world has been designed to be touched and manipulated by hands, both in terms of realistic physics and how real hands move through virtual objects. The best public information we have to this end is a recent DigiPen presentation from a Valve developer. Ever wondered how doors are constructed in VR? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kzu2Y33yKM">Valve developer Kerry Davis went on for over 30 minutes on the subject</a>, and our sources indicate that this scrutiny went into every single hand-manipulation system within <em>HLA</em>.</p>
<p>Our sources have told us not to expect one iconic weapon in <em>HLA</em>, however. Each of these sources mentioned that a virtual crowbar was tested at one point in the game's multi-year development but was eventually scrapped. To be clear: we don't have conclusive evidence that the crowbar won't eventually appear in the game in one way or another. (If Valve plans to upgrade the game with a physical crowbar purchase, my sources sure haven't heard of it.)</p>
<h2>Intentionally vague confidence...</h2>
<p>After getting over my initial shock that a new <em>Half-Life</em> game exists, I've come to be astounded by another likely outcome: that this new game will be a masterclass example of how to build an adventure game around the unique features of virtual reality hardware.</p>

<p>I have played quite a few VR quest and adventure games since home VR headsets began launching in 2016. Some have employed compelling mechanics but have run out of fresh ideas all too quickly. Others have slapped familiar combat and puzzles into a VR headset in ways that would have worked just as well on a flat TV screen. And still others have made VR users sit or stand around waiting for dialogue or long, boring walks to transpire.</p>
<p>What I know about <em>HLA</em>, at this point, has me convinced that Valve's VR game design teams share the same frustrations with been-there-VR'ed-that quests and that <em>HLA</em> won't repeat their mistakes. The little bit I know about hand manipulation in the game has me <em>tingling</em> with excitement.</p>
<p>Plus, as Valve's first game built from the ground up to tap into the company's long-in-development <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/valve-developing-three-full-length-vr-games/">Source 2</a> engine, I'm hopeful that we're in for a whole new caliber of facial animations and world details in a VR game—much like how <em>Half-Life 2</em>'s use of the first Source engine blew gamers away in 2004.</p>
<p>Whether we're in for a game that earns the <em>Half-Life</em> namesake, on the other hand, remains to be seen. Will it actually be long enough in terms of a satisfying single-player campaign? Will its plot's mysteries, as staged between two major games in the series, be sold in compelling sequences seen from a VR perspective? Will we get a VR robot dog as a pet?</p>
<p>I'd love to assure readers that we won't have long to wait to learn the answers to these questions and more, but, you know, Valve Time is a thing. We'll temper our excitement as much as we can with zero assurances of a true release date until the game is in both our literal and virtual hands, and we at Ars will keep you posted as soon as Valve lets us fake like Alyx for the sake of an <em>HLA</em> preview.</p>

(credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="http://www.ecns.cn/">China News Service</a>)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Imagine you're trying to make a left turn onto a busy road. Car after car rolls past, keeping you trapped as your frustration rises. Finally, a generous driver decelerates enough to create a gap. A check of the traffic from the opposite direction, a quick bit of acceleration, and you're successfully merged into traffic.</p>
<p>This same scene plays out across the world countless times a day. And it's a situation where inferring both the physics and the motives of your fellow drivers is difficult, as evidenced by the fact that the United States sees 1.4 million accidents each year from drivers in the process of turning. Now imagine throwing autonomous vehicles into the mix. These are typically limited to evaluating only the physics and to make conservative decisions in situations where information is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Now, a group of computer scientists has figured out how to improve autonomous vehicle (AV) performance in these circumstances. The scientists have essentially given their AVs a limited theory of mind, allowing the vehicles to better interpret what the behaviors of their nearby human drives are telling them.</p>
<h2>Mind the theory</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/great-apes-pass-a-false-belief-test-hinting-at-a-theory-of-mind/">Theory of mind</a> comes so easily to us that it's difficult to recognize how rare it is outside of our species. We're easily able to recognize that our fellow humans have minds like our own, and we use that recognition to infer things like the state of their knowledge and their likely motivations. These inferences are essential to most of our social activities, driving included. While a friendly wave can make for an unambiguous signal that your fellow driver is offering you space in their lane, we can often make inferences based simply on the behavior of their car.</p>

<p>And, critically, autonomous vehicles aren't especially good at this. In many cases, their own behavior doesn't send signals back to other drivers. A study of accidents involving AVs in California indicated that over half of them involved the AV being rear-ended because a human driver couldn't figure out what in the world it was doing. (Volvo, among others, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/volvo-gets-optimistic-about-the-future-with-the-360c-driverless-concept/">working to change that</a>.)</p>
<p>It's unrealistic to think that we'll give AVs a full-blown theory of mind any time soon. AIs are simply not that advanced, and it would be excessive for cars, which only have to deal with a limited range of human behaviors. But a group of researchers at MIT and Delft University of Technology has decided that putting an extremely limited theory of mind in place for certain driving decisions, including turns and merges, should be possible.</p>
<p>The idea behind the researchers' work, described in a new paper in PNAS, involves a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_value_orientations">social value orientation</a>, which is a way of measuring how selfish or community-oriented an individual's actions are. While there are undoubtedly detailed surveys that can provide a meticulous description of a person's social value orientation, autonomous vehicles generally won't have the time to be giving their fellow drivers surveys.</p>
<p>So the researchers distilled social value orientation into four categories: altruists, who try to maximize the enjoyment of their fellow drivers; prosocial drivers, who try to take actions that allow all other drivers to benefit (which may occasionally involve selfishly flooring it); individualists, who maximize their own driving experience; and competitive drivers, who only care about having a better driving experience than those around them.</p>
<h2>Value-oriented</h2>
<p>The researchers developed a formula that would let them calculate the expected driving trajectory for each of these categories given the starting position of other cars. The autonomous vehicle was programmed to compare the trajectories of actual drivers to the calculated version and use that to determine which of the four categories the drivers were likely to be in. Given that classification, the vehicle could then project what their future actions would be. As the researchers wrote, "we extend the ability of AVs' reasoning by incorporating estimates of the other drivers' personality and driving style from social cues."</p>
<p>This is substantially different from some game-theory work that's been done in the area. That work has assumed that every driver is always maximizing their own gain; if altruism emerges, it's only incidental to this maximization. This new work, in contrast, bakes altruistic behavior into its calculations and recognizes that drivers are complicated and may change their tendencies as situations evolve. In fact, previous studies had indicated that in contexts other than driving, about half of the people tested showed prosocial behavior, with another 40% being selfish.</p>
<p>With the system in place, the researchers obtained data on vehicle locations and trajectories as drivers merged onto a highway, a situation that often requires the generosity of fellow drivers. With the social value orientation system in place, the autonomous driver was able make more accurate predictions of its fellow drivers' trajectories than it could without—prediction errors dropped by 25%. The system also worked on lane changes on crowded freeways, as well as turns into traffic.</p>
<p>Using these evaluations, the researchers could also make some inferences using the traffic patterns they had. For example, they found that a highway driver may start out selfishly following the car in front of them, shift to altruistic as they decelerate to allow a driver to merge, then switch right back to a selfish approach. Similarly, drivers facing a merge onto a freeway typically ended up being competitive—something you see every time a vehicle pulls out and slows down everyone who was stuck in the lane behind it.</p>
<p>While we're still a long way off from giving autonomous vehicles a general AI or a full theory of mind, the research shows that you can get significant benefits from giving AVs a very limited one. And it's a nice demonstration that if we want any autonomous system to integrate with something that's currently a social activity, then paying attention to what social scientists have figured out about those activities can be incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=111819_PR%20MacBook%20Pro%2016%20Teardown&amp;utm_content=111819_PR%20MacBook%20Pro%2016%20Teardown+CID_d127ab6d541899ddcba51548a64c5d68&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=MacBook%20Pro%2016">teardown</a> of the 16-inch MacBook Pro uncovered a laptop that is a sort of hybrid between the 2015 MacBook Pro and its butterfly keyboard-equipped successors. iFixit performs and publishes these teardowns both to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/hackers-farmers-and-doctors-unite-support-for-right-to-repair-laws-slowly-grows/">advocate for repairable devices</a> and to drive its own revenue by selling fix kits to readers.</p>
<p>The team found that the new scissor-switch keyboard has deep similarities to Apple's time-tested, standalone Magic Keyboard, as well as to the keyboards found in Mac laptops before the introduction of the butterfly mechanism. In fact, you can even swap in some of the old Magic Keyboard keycaps. The teardown writeup notes that there is no dust-proofing membrane on the keyboard switches, suggesting that Apple does not expect the same problems caused by particulate matter that users repeatedly ran into with the butterfly switches.</p>
<p>However, the keyboard assembly is still riveted in place, and repairing damaged switches is likely to be no more convenient or cost-effective than has been the case with the butterfly keyboards. Given the positive track record of the Magic Keyboard, you're much less likely to see failures in this keyboard—but if you do, you'll still be dependent on either your warranty or AppleCare to save you from big costs. Even most savvy users likely won't be able to perform the repairs themselves. For this reason and others, iFixit gave the new MacBook Pro a 1 out of 10 repairability rating.</p>
<p>The teardown also found notably larger batteries (totaling 99.8 Wh, barely under the FAA maximum) and a display hinge. Besides the keyboard, the other big story is an improved thermal system. iFixit discovered larger exhaust holes and bigger impeller blades, enabling up to 28% more airflow. This will likely help the MacBook Pro sustain performance on its highest-end CPU configurations under heavy loads better than its predecessors have.</p>
<p>Some of the ensuing conversation in comments and on Twitter has revealed one of the many weaknesses of Apple's "Pro" branding, with many users lamenting "almost no repair choices even though it's a 'Pro' device." Part of the problem with Apple's naming scheme is that "Pro" means radically different things to professionals in different fields. Some professionals might be entirely unconcerned with user-serviceability even as it's a chief concern for others.</p>
<p>Whatever kind of pro you are, though, it looks like the new MacBook Pro is designed to address two of the key criticisms of its immediate predecessor: unreliable keyboards, and inadequate heat management for sustained high-end performance.</p>
<p>We're testing the 16-inch MacBook Pro now, and we'll publish our final review later this week.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>A lawsuit filed against Comcast today accuses the cable company of using its market power to try to drive a regional sports network out of business.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.193357/gov.uscourts.cod.193357.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> was filed in US District Court in Colorado by Altitude Sports, a network that broadcasts games played by the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, and other local professional and college teams. Altitude has been blacked out on Comcast since August 31, as the companies haven't agreed on what price Comcast should pay to carry the network.</p>
<p>Filing a lawsuit is at least partly a negotiating tactic in cases like this one, but Altitude claims that this is more than a simple price dispute. Comcast is offering less than Altitude's actual costs because it wants to drive Altitude out of business and then acquire the TV rights to the Denver sports teams itself, Altitude alleges.</p>
<p>"This complaint alleges textbook anticompetitive conduct," Altitude lawyer William Isaacson said in an <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/altitude-sports--entertainment-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-comcast-300960117.html">announcement</a> of the suit. "This lawsuit aims to stop Comcast from abusing its monopoly power to impose terms on Altitude to drive it out of business and prey on Denver-region families."</p>
<p>Comcast would be able to "quickly and easily take over regional sports production" in the Denver area if it forces Altitude out of business, the lawsuit said.</p>
<h2>Comcast dominates Denver TV market</h2>
<p>Comcast <a href="http://www.comcastsportsnet.com/">owns the regional sports networks</a> in major cities such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. But Altitude is owned by Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, which also owns the Nuggets and Avalanche, so Comcast has to purchase access to the channel in order to broadcast the top sports teams in Denver.</p>
<p>Comcast has a 57-percent share of the pay-TV market in the Denver area, compared to DirecTV's 25 percent, the lawsuit said. Comcast's dominance of the market "has increased since its first Altitude agreement over 15 years ago, as part of an unprecedented wave of [pay-TV] consolidation, expansion, and vertical integration," the lawsuit said. Altitude says this allows Comcast to exercise <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopsony.asp">monopsony</a> power, in which a buyer becomes so large that it effectively controls the market.</p>
<p>In the recent negotiations, Altitude offered a five-year contract renewal with terms similar to the previous deal, but Comcast demanded "dramatic cuts in rates to be paid to Altitude," Altitude's lawsuit said. Comcast also proposed moving the Altitude channel from a cable package that reaches at least 70 percent of Comcast's local subscribers to one that only 15 percent of Comcast customers subscribe to, which would lower the amount Altitude can charge for TV advertisements, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Comcast knows these proposals "are economically unsustainable for Altitude or any RSN [regional sports network]," Altitude said. The rates offered by Comcast "were entirely unreasonable and unworkable for Altitude given the costs it pays to rights holders and its production costs," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Comcast also rejected Altitude's offer of a one-year extension under the previous rates and terms, which would have given "the parties more time to negotiate a long-term solution and avoid a situation in which Altitude was blacked out by Comcast," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Here's one of the key parts of the complaint, in which Altitude details its allegation that Comcast's long-term plan is to buy the broadcasting rights to Denver sports teams:</p>
<blockquote><p>By negotiating fees and carriage that undermine an independent RSN and require it to charge below its costs, Comcast knows that it can cause any independent RSN to go out of business. Comcast may then reacquire the content by either purchasing the RSN's television rights themselves or by ensuring that the RSN becomes part of some other consolidated ownership. Once Comcast reacquires the content, the subscribers return, mitigating any longterm losses. For these reasons, Comcast is incentivized to suffer a short-term temporary loss of subscribers to achieve enormous long-term gains.</p>
<p>Comcast is now using its monopsony power in the wholesale purchase of sports programming in the Denver DMA (designated market area) to drive Altitude out as a competitor in this exact manner.</p>
<p>After Comcast puts Altitude out of business, Comcast will attempt either to buy Altitude or set up its own RSN to replace Altitude. This means that Comcast is not only violating the antitrust laws' prohibition on acquiring or maintaining monopoly (monopsony) power as a buyer in the Programming Market (the market where Altitude sells its productions); Comcast is also illegally attempting to monopolize the Production Market (the market in which Altitude and other RSNs compete to create programming) by replacing Altitude with Comcast's own captive RSN. Comcast's attempt to monopolize the Production Market is a separate and independent violation of the antitrust laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comcast has taken a far different approach with RSNs it owns itself, Altitude said. "Comcast has not made demands of or imposed drastic rate cuts or carriage reductions on its own affiliated RSNs throughout the country," Altitude said. For the Comcast-owned networks, Comcast continues to "sign new contracts for rates, equal to or higher than what it previously paid to Altitude," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Altitude's lawsuit asks the court for a declaratory judgment that Comcast violated antitrust laws and "tortiously interfered" with Altitude's business relationships with sports teams and advertisers. Altitude also asked for compensatory and punitive damages and an order that Comcast "distribute Altitude's programming on reasonable, non-discriminatory terms."</p>
<h2>Comcast charges regional sports fee</h2>
<p>Altitude was also blacked out on DirecTV, but the blackout ended in early November when the companies agreed on a price and distribution terms. Both Comcast and DirecTV charge a monthly "Regional Sports Network" fee to cover the cost of distributing networks like Altitude. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/directv-kept-charging-regional-sports-fee-while-channel-was-blacked-out/">investigating the companies'</a> decision to keep charging the fee during the blackout.</p>
<p>While DirecTV owner AT&amp;T <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/atts-stinginess-on-refunds-makes-even-comcast-customer-service-look-good/">made it difficult</a> for customers to get refunds on that fee during the blackout, Comcast automatically issued partial bill credits to account for the blacked-out channel. Comcast justified its decision to charge the remainder of the fee by noting that it also carries AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain channel, which broadcasts Colorado Rockies baseball games, and the Pac-12 network that broadcasts college sports.</p>
<p>Altitude's lawsuit criticizes the Regional Sports Network fee, saying that it amounts to a "monopoly rent" charged to consumers. "The fees Comcast pays for regional sports programming in the Denver DMA dropped dramatically, but Comcast offered only a token bill reduction (as a public relations move after consumer outcry)," Altitude said.</p>
<p>We contacted Comcast about Altitude's lawsuit and will update this article if we get a response.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Back in 2012, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/supreme-court-holds-warrantless-gps-tracking-unconstitutional/">ruled</a> that it's illegal for the police to attach a GPS tracking device to someone's car without a warrant. But what if you find a GPS tracking device on your car? Can you remove it?</p>
<p>A little more than a year ago, the state of Indiana charged a suspected drug dealer with theft for removing a government-owned GPS tracking device from his SUV. This month, the state's Supreme Court began <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=sup&amp;search=&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=False&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">considering the case</a>, and some justices seemed skeptical of the government's argument.</p>
<p>"I'm really struggling with how is that theft," said Justice Steven David during <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=&amp;search=heuring&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=True&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">recent oral arguments</a>.</p>
<h2>One time in Warrick County</h2>
<p>The case began in July 2018, when the Warrick County Sheriff's Office got a warrant to attach a GPS tracking device to Derek Heuring's car. Information from a confidential informant had led them to believe that Heuring was using the vehicle to sell meth.</p>
<p>The GPS device transmitted data for a little more than a week. Then it stopped. Officers suspected Heuring had discovered and removed it.</p>

<p>After waiting another 10 days to see if it would start working again, detectives applied for a warrant to search Heuring's home and a nearby property belonging to Heuring's parents. US law requires law enforcement to show probable cause that a crime had been committed before engaging in a search. In this case, police said they suspected that Heuring had committed the crime of theft by taking the GPS device.</p>
<p>Police did find the tracking device. They also found methamphatamine and drug paraphernalia—evidence that police say show that Heuring had been dealing drugs.</p>
<p>So Heuring was charged both with drug dealing and with theft of the GPS device.</p>
<h2>Is it theft to remove a GPS tracking device?</h2>
<p>At trial, Heuring's legal team argued that the search had been illegal because the police didn't have probable cause to believe their client had committed theft. The defense pointed out that the device could have fallen off the car by accident or simply malfunctioned.</p>
<p>Even if Heuring did take the device off the vehicle, he couldn't have known for sure that it belonged to the government. It wasn't exactly labeled as the property of the Warrick County Sheriff's Office. Most important, it's not clear that taking an unwanted device off your car is theft—even if you know who it belongs to.</p>
<p>With the case now at the state Supreme Court, the stakes are high. If Heuring can show that the police lacked probable cause to search his house, he could get all of the evidence gathered in the search thrown out—not only evidence of GPS device theft, but evidence of drug dealing, too.</p>
<p>An appellate court ruled against Heuring in July, leading to the case <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=sup&amp;search=&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=False&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">reaching the Indiana Supreme Court</a> earlier this month. Initially, multiple justices seemed skeptical of the idea that taking a tracking device off your own car amounted to theft.</p>
<p>"If somebody wants to find me to do harm to me and it's not the police and they put a tracking device on my car and I find a tracking device and I dispose of it after stomping on it 25 times, I would hope they would not be able to go to a local prosecutor and somehow I'm getting charges filed against me for destroying someone else's property," Justice David said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the government acknowledged that it wouldn't be theft to remove a tracking device put there by a private party. But he argued that things are different when the government has a warrant to use a tracking device. The device had a legal basis for being on the car, the lawyer argued. By removing it and preventing tracking, Heuring was depriving the government of the use of its property.</p>
<p>The Memorandum Decision for <em>Heuring v. Indiana </em>from the Indiana appeals court is available as a <a href="https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/07181901mgr.pdf">PDF</a> through the state government's website. The state Supreme Court is still currently considering the case after those <a href="https://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/20191108/justices-question-warrant-search-over-gps-tracker">oral arguments on November 7</a>.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/trump-tries-to-shut-huawei-out-of-us-market-with-executive-order/">six months now</a>, the Trump Administration has banned US companies from doing business with Huawei. Nearly the entire time, there has also been a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/google-and-huawei-can-support-devices-for-90-days-thanks-to-us-ban-exemption/">temporary general export license</a>" provision that allows current Huawei customers to continue to receive support for existing devices. The original order in May gave existing customers a 90-day license, and it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/report-us-expected-to-give-huawei-another-90-day-export-license/">was then extended</a> for another 90 days after that. That leads us to November 18, and today the US has given Huawei a third 90-day support window.</p>

Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications-equipment manufacturer and second largest smartphone manufacturer after Samsung (and before Apple). The company doesn't have a huge presence in the US, in part because the US House Intelligence Committee has for years <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/congress-accuses-chinese-tech-giants-of-un-american-activities/">flagged Huawei</a> as security threat thanks to its close ties to the Chinese government. The US government has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/trump-signs-bill-banning-feds-from-using-huawei-zte-technology/">banned federal agencies</a> from using Huawei equipment, and it has used political pressure to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/political-pressure-reportedly-kills-huaweiatt-smartphone-deal/">shut down consumer deals</a> with US carriers. Huawei has still managed to get some telecommunication equipment in the US, though, particularly thanks to rural carriers in states like Wyoming and Oregon. A coalition of these smaller carriers, the Rural Wireless Association, estimates that replacing Huawei and ZTE equipment could cost its members <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652769/huawei-china-security-rural-internet-rip-replace">up to a billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>“There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities—we don’t want to knock them out," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday. "So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate.”</p>
<p>As far as smartphones go, Huawei could possibly build hardware without further assistance from US companies, but doing it without US software is tough. The company has already had to ship the Mate 30 Pro in Europe <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/huaweis-new-flagship-smartphone-ships-without-google-apps/">without the Google apps</a>, meaning it's one of the few Android smartphones that doesn't come with Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and the Play Store (which provides access to 2.8 million Android apps). For now, Huawei is focusing on Android with its "Huawei Mobile Services" in lieu of Google apps. Huawei Mobile Services have been up and running in China for some time since Google Play is not available in China. The company is also working on its own operating system called "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/huawei-announces-its-first-operating-system-harmonyos/">HarmonyOS</a>," but the company said that won't be ready for smartphones for at least three years.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to today's expiration or renewal deadline, Huawei has been out in force in the media. The overall messaging has been "the US needs Huawei more than Huawei needs the US."</p>
<p>For instance, Huawei's Chairman, Liang Hua, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/huawei-chairman-speaks-about-us-blacklist-impact-at-east-tech-west.html">told CNBC</a> today, “No matter whether there will be an extension, in terms of its real impact on Huawei, it will be very limited. Our products are able to be shipped without the reliance on the US components and chips.” In translated remarks, Liang said banning Huawei would “pose a bigger damage” to the US than it would to Huawei, and the move would "only damage the broadband network suppliers in those rural areas. It would only cause a bigger digital divide in the US.”</p>
<p>This latest 90-day extension means we should be dealing with this again on February 17, 2020.</p>

<p>Justice Department officials have long pushed for some sort of backdoor to permit warranted surveillance and searches of encrypted communications. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/ag-barr-is-pushing-facebook-to-backdoor-whatsapp-and-halt-encryption-plans/">Recently, that push has been taken international</a> with Attorney General William Barr and his counterparts from the United Kingdom and Australia making an open plea to Facebook to delay plans to use end-to-end encryption across all the company's messaging tools.</p>

<p>Now, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigations are <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-interpol-plans-condemn-encryption-203218710.html">attempting to get an even larger international consensus</a> on banning end-to-end encryption by way of a draft resolution authored by officials at the FBI for the International Criminal Police Organization's <a href="https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2019/Safeguarding-children-from-harm-a-priority-for-global-experts">37th Meeting of the INTERPOL Specialists Group on Crimes against Children</a>. The event took place from November 12 to November 15 at the INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France.</p>
<p>A draft of the resolution viewed by Ars Technica stated that INTERPOL would "strongly urge providers of technology services to allow for lawful access to encrypted data enabled or facilitated by their systems" in the interest of fighting child sexual exploitation. Currently, it is not clear whether Interpol will issue a statement.</p>
<p>The draft resolution went on to lay responsibility for child exploitation upon the tech industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current path towards default end-to-end encryption, with no provision for lawful access, does not allow for the protection of the world’s children from sexual exploitation. Technology providers must act and design their services in a way that protects user privacy, on the one hand, while providing user safety, on the other hand. Failure to allow for Lawful Access on their platforms and products, provides a safe haven to offenders utilizing these to sexually exploit children, and inhibits our global law enforcement efforts to protect children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Attendees of the conference told Ars that the resolution's statement was due to be published this week. But in an email to the New York Times' Nicole Perlroth, an INTERPOL spokesperson denied that the resolution was considered:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Interpol telling me this Reuter’s story is inaccurate:</p>
<p>Dear Ms Perlroth,</p>
<p>As per our statement there are, and were, no plans at this time for the INTERPOL General Secretariat to issue a statement in relation to encryption.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Press Office<a href="https://t.co/EItFe0D3Je">https://t.co/EItFe0D3Je</a></p>
<p>— Nicole Perlroth (@nicoleperlroth) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1196502885883756544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Ars requested comment from an FBI official and has not yet received a response.</p>
<h2>Easy button</h2>
<p>In a statement that flies in the face of the consensus of cryptographers and other technical experts, the draft resolution asserted that "technologists agree" that designing systems to "[allow] for lawful access to data, while maintaining customer privacy…can be implemented in a way that would enhance privacy while maintaining strong cyber security." In order to "honor and enforce" standards for prohibiting the distribution of "child sexual abuse material," the draft resolution states, "providers should fully comply with court orders authorizing law enforcement agencies access to data related to criminal investigations involving the sexual exploitation of children."</p>
<p>Facebook and other companies currently comply with warranted requests for data under the terms of the CLOUD Act—a law passed in 2018 that requires technology companies to provide data requested by warrant or subpoena to law enforcement, regardless of where in the world it is stored. But the officials behind this draft resolution claim such compliance cannot be achieved while allowing end-to-end encryption of communications.</p>
<p>As Barr and his compatriots noted in their October letter to Facebook, Facebook's ability to run analytics on and moderate content within users' communications <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/the-broken-record-why-barrs-call-against-end-to-end-encryption-is-nuts/#p3">amounted to 90 percent of the reports of child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2018</a>. By providing end-to-end encryption, officials contend, Facebook would essentially allow future child pornography distribution to "go dark" and prevent law enforcement from gathering evidence against suspects.</p>
<p>Today, there's little evidence that encryption has been a major impediment to interception of communications by law enforcement to date. According to <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/wiretap-report-2018">statistics from the Administrative Office of the US Courts</a>, out of a total of 2,937 wiretaps in 2018, only 146 were encrypted—and of those, only 58 could not be decrypted.</p>
<p>Facebook has already deployed end-to-end encryption in products such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger (though Messenger does not provide end-to-end encryption by default). In response to Barr's letter, Facebook officials responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>End-to-end encryption already protects the messages of over a billion people every day. It is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy. We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/">has repeatedly reported</a>, many experts in the field of cryptography and security agree with Facebook's assessment. The security community has largely opposed most of the pushes for encryption backdoors on the grounds that any secret "golden key" to decrypt encrypted messages would be technically infeasible—and potentially exploitable by malicious third parties.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFdzpVt5rbk?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">When SyFy unexpectedly canceled its award-winning science-fiction drama <em>The Expanse</em>, Amazon Prime snapped it up. </p></div>
<p>Fans of sci-fi series <em>The Expanse</em> have been patiently awaiting the much-anticipated fourth season. That wait is almost over. Amazon Prime just dropped the first full-length trailer for the new season, featuring the intrepid crew of the <em>Rocinante</em> venturing into exploring the many worlds beyond the Ring.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/weve-got-our-first-peek-at-s4-of-the-expanse-and-an-airdate-december-13/">we reported</a> back in July when the first teaser dropped, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)"><em>The Expanse</em></a> is based on a series of novels by James S.A. Corey (the pen name for writing team Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) that explore interplanetary tensions that are breaking out all over a solar system—mostly between Earthers, Martians, and "Belters"—long since colonized by humans. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/the-expanse-is-the-best-new-science-fiction-series-in-years/">Part mystery, part political thriller</a>, part classic space opera, <em>The Expanse</em> has earned almost <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/the-expanse-is-the-best-new-science-fiction-series-in-years/">nothing but praise</a> from critics and its devoted fans alike, not just for its gripping storytelling, but also for its excellent use of <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/science-expanse-tv-show-sticks-space-realities-one-big-exception/">accurate physics</a>. The third season earned a rare 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes (seasons one and two earned 76% and 96%, respectively).</p>
<p>So it was something of a shock when SyFy <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/05/the-expanse-canceled-syfy-after-three-seasons-to-be-shopped-1202388026/">cancelled the series</a>, citing "restrictive distribution arrangements," specifically, just first-run linear rights in the US. Fortunately, Amazon soon stepped in to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/the-expanse-has-officially-been-saved/">save the show</a>.</p>
<p>Season 4 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20697608/amazon-prime-video-the-expanse-james-s-a-corey-science-fiction-cibola-burn">supposedly based on</a> <em>Cibola Burn</em>, the fourth novel in the series, and it marks a new narrative direction as the crew of the <em>Rocinante</em> explores new worlds beyond the Ring Gate on a mission for the UN. Apparently, the access to thousands of Earth-like planets has "<a href="https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/trailers/1110645-new-expanse-season-4-trailer">created a land rush</a> and furthered tensions between the opposing nations of Earth, Mars and the Belt." The ship's first stop: Ilus, a colonial world where a dispute over the planet's rich natural resources has broken out between Royal Charter Energy (RCE)—the corporation that claimed rights to the world—and the first settlers there.</p>

          UN Deputy Undersecretary of Executive Administration  Chrisjen Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo) has a mission for the crew of the Rocinante.                      [credit:

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>This full-length trailer fleshes out a few more details. Via narration in the distinct raspy voice of Chrisjen Avasarala (<a title="Shohreh Aghdashloo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohreh_Aghdashloo">Shohreh Aghdashloo</a>), UN deputy undersecretary of executive administration, we learn that the UN initially sent a ship out to Ilus to control the situation. "The mission did not go as planned," Avasarala dryly observes, as we see images of a hole ripped in the ship's side and the ship crashing, scattering pieces across the planet's desert-like terrain. The <em>Rocinante</em> crew is charged with finding out exactly what is going on in this world beyond the Ring, with instructions to evacuate the Belters and themselves immediately if the situation warrants.</p>
<p>They are greeted upon arrival to "New Terra" by Adolphus Murty (Burn Gorman), chief of security for RCE, who is none too friendly toward the Belter refugees: "There is no version of this where we leave these squatters and murderers in possession of this planet," he says. The refugees are equally defiant: "This place is our only hope. We're not giving it up."</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the onset of mysterious swarms—similar to dust storms, only composed of what appear to be tiny robots. "That's protomolecule tech," <em>Rocinante</em> Captain Jim Holden (Steven Strait) observes. (<em>Expanse</em> fans may recall that an alien civilization created the protomolecule, which featured heavily in season three.) There's also evidence that various alien artifacts on the planet are "waking up," perhaps in response to something Holden has done. "I opened those gates, so I'm responsible for anything that comes through," he says. Now, the crew must figure out how to turn off whatever it is he has turned on.</p>
<p>Season 4 of <em>The Expanse</em> debuts on December 13, 2019 on Amazon Prime.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Last week, NASA's inspector general <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/nasa-report-finds-boeing-seat-prices-are-60-higher-than-spacex/">issued a report</a> critical of NASA's extra payments worth $287 million to Boeing for operational flights of its Starliner spacecraft. "In our judgment, the additional compensation was unnecessary," the agency's inspector general, Paul Martin, wrote in his report.</p>
<p>For the first time, the report also published an estimate of seat prices that NASA will pay Boeing for crewed Starliner missions to the International Space Station alongside prices the organization will pay for SpaceX's Dragon vehicle: $90 million for Starliner and $55 million for Dragon. Each capsule is expected to carry four astronauts to the space station during a nominal mission.</p>

<p>This report has evidently not sat well with Boeing, which on Monday fired off a lengthy statement in reply to the inspector general's report.</p>
<h2>“Strongly disagree”</h2>
<p>“We strongly disagree with the report’s conclusions about CST-100 Starliner pricing and readiness, and we owe it to the space community and the American public to share the facts the Inspector General missed,” Jim Chilton, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space and Launch, stated in a release <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-11-18-Boeing-Statement-Regarding-OIG-Report-on-NASAs-Commercial-Crew-Program">posted on Boeing's website</a>.</p>
<p>Boeing's response takes issue with several parts of NASA's report. But the company appears especially exercised about the claim that NASA overpaid Boeing for seats on the third through sixth Starliner missions, payment over and above what was originally agreed upon as part of the company's fixed price contract with the space agency.</p>

<p>"Through fair and open negotiations with NASA in a competitive environment, we offered single-mission pricing for post-certification missions 3-6, thus enabling additional flexibility and schedule resiliency to enhance future mission readiness," the Boeing statement reads.</p>
<p>In his IG report, Martin characterized these negotiations as "prolonged," and he said Boeing kept pressing NASA even after the agency initially declined to pay extra funds. And far from being "fair and open," Martin noted that in paying Boeing what the inspector found to be unnecessary costs, NASA denied the same opportunity to the other company in the commercial crew program. "SpaceX was not provided an opportunity to propose a solution even though the company previously offered shorter production lead times than Boeing," the NASA report states.</p>
<h2>“Actual experience”</h2>
<p>In its response, Boeing said its per-seat price was not $90 million, although the company declined to say what its actual price is or provide any documentation to support this claim. "For proprietary, competitive reasons Boeing does not disclose specific pricing information, but we are confident our average seat pricing to NASA is below the figure cited," the company's statement reads.</p>
<p>As part of its defense, Boeing also took a curious shot at its competitor, SpaceX. "Starliner flies on the most reliable lifter in the business, an Atlas V modified for human spaceflight safety by people with actual experience in the domain," the company stated.</p>

<p>It is not clear what "actual experience in the domain" refers to. A request from Ars for clarification was not immediately returned by Boeing.</p>
<p>However, it is not like United Launch Alliance or Boeing has legions of employees on its roster who have experience modifying a rocket for human launch. Such an activity was last done in the United States in the early 1960s, when the Martin Marietta Corporation modified the Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile for use in NASA's Gemini program.</p>

<p>It has only been 11 days since Apple released iOS 13.2.2, but once again we're seeing evidence of a greatly increased update cadence. Today sees the release of iOS and iPadOS 13.2.3.</p>
<p>This latest release is mostly a bug fix update—of course, that was apparent from the version number. Traditionally, Apple numbers its updates to signify their importance. Top-level updates like iOS 12 or iOS 13 are annualized major releases that start a new update cycle. One decimal point down (like iOS 13.2) denotes an update that adds major new features. One further point down (like this one, iOS 13.2.1) usually indicates that it is a bug fix update.</p>
<p>The update this week fixes problems users have encountered with search in the Mail, Files, and Notes apps. It also addresses a bug with attachments in Messages, an issue that stopped apps from downloading properly, and another with Exchange accounts under Mail that has frustrated many users.</p>
<p>Here are Apple's update notes for both iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3:</p>
<blockquote><p>iOS 13.2.3 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view</li>
<li>Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background</li>
<li>Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update should roll out to all devices supported by iOS or iPadOS 13 today. Users can check for it in their devices' Settings apps.</p>
<p>Apple is also working on a major feature release, iOS and iPadOS 13.3. That update is currently in beta with developers. Its biggest feature at present is the ability to set messaging and communication limits in Screen Time. It also allows users to disable the appearance of Animoji and Memoji stickers in the system's emoji keyboard.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere will leave the company's top job after his contract runs out on April 30, 2020, <a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Mike-Sievert-to-Succeed-John-Legere-as-CEO-of-T-Mobile-on-May-1-2020/default.aspx">T-Mobile announced today</a>. Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's president and chief operating officer, will replace Legere as CEO on May 1.</p>
<p>Legere, who became CEO in September 2012, revived a struggling company and led the "Un-carrier" strategy that pitched T-Mobile as a customer-friendly alternative to the AT&amp;T/Verizon duopoly. T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/our-story/un-carrier-history">Un-carrier moves</a> changed some of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/t-mobile-is-sorry-for-charging-greedy-predatory-fees-will-mostly-stop/">punitive business practices</a> that mobile carriers routinely inflicted on customers.</p>
<p>But Legere's T-Mobile also helped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/t-mobiles-video-throttling-may-not-violate-net-neutrality-lawyers-say/">lead the way</a> in making <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/wireless-throttling-senators-ask-four-major-carriers-about-video-slowdowns/">throttling of streaming video</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/verizon-to-start-throttling-all-smartphone-videos-to-480p-or-720p/">standard industry practice.</a> T-Mobile was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/t-mobile-punished-by-fcc-for-hidden-limits-on-unlimited-data/">punished by the federal government</a> in 2016 for failing to adequately disclose speed and data restrictions on its "unlimited data" plans, and like other carriers, it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/t-mobile-sprint-and-att-still-selling-your-location-data-report-says/">sold its customers' real-time location data</a> to third parties. Legere often offered better deals than competitors, but US wireless prices still rank <a href="http://research.rewheel.fi/downloads/The_state_of_4G_pricing_DFMonitor_10th_release_2H2018_PUBLIC.pdf">among the most expensive in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Legere used a brash and combative style to promote T-Mobile, often insulting larger rivals AT&amp;T and Verizon by calling them "Dumb and Dumber." In 2017, he <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/the-dumber-championship">said</a> that T-Mobile's scientific research found that Verizon was the "Dumber" part of that pair. Legere will leave as T-Mobile attempts to complete its pending acquisition of Sprint, a deal that would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/dojs-plan-to-make-dish-the-fourth-major-carrier-has-a-fatal-flaw/">reduce wireless competition in the US</a> and make T-Mobile roughly the same size as AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>Legere helped T-Mobile and Sprint win the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/its-official-us-government-approves-t-mobilesprint-merger/">approval</a> of the merger, but the companies must still defeat a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/t-mobilesprint-merger-faces-big-test-as-nine-states-sue-to-block-it/">lawsuit</a> filed by a coalition of state attorneys general in order to complete the merger.</p>
<p>Legere was in talks with WeWork to take the CEO job at that company, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-11573494028">reported last week</a>. But Legere disputed that news today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970391/tmobile-john-legere-leaving-as-ceo-2020-mike-sievert">reportedly saying</a> that "I was never having discussions to run WeWork."</p>
<h2>Legere led “complete transformation”</h2>
<p>T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom gave Legere high praise today.</p>
<p>"John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO. As the architect of the Un-carrier strategy and the company's complete transformation, John has put T-Mobile US in an incredibly strong position," Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges said in the leadership-change announcement.<div class="image shortcode-img right medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert.jpeg"><img alt='T-Mobile executive Mike Sievert.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert-300x404.jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert.jpeg 2x" alt='T-Mobile executive Mike Sievert.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert.jpeg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">T-Mobile executive Mike Sievert.</a> (credit: T-Mobile)</p></div></p>
<p>The switch from Legere to Sievert is the culmination of a "multi-year succession planning process led by John Legere and the Board of Directors," T-Mobile said. Legere will remain as a member of the board after leaving the CEO position.</p>
<p>Sievert joined T-Mobile as its chief marketing officer in 2012, was promoted to chief operating officer in 2015, and added president to his list of titles in 2018. Legere was previously both president and CEO.</p>
<p>"I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him," Legere said today. "Mike is well prepared to lead T-Mobile into the future. He has a deep understanding of where T-Mobile has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry."</p>
<p>Sievert said that his "mission is to build on T-Mobile's industry-leading reputation for... deliver[ing] an outstanding customer experience" and to make T-Mobile "the leading mobile carrier" and "one of the most admired companies in America."</p>
