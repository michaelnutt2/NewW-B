<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is back once again with a new round of deals and price drops. Today's list is headlined by a quick PSA for those who subscribe to a Verizon unlimited data plan or plan to subscribe to a Fios home Internet plan: if you're at all interested the new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/we-now-know-what-disney-will-look-like-plus-a-few-new-exclusive-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Disney+ streaming service</a>, you can get a <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/solutions-and-services/disneyplus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12-month subscription at no extra cost</a>. As a refresher, Disney's Netflix competitor launched on Tuesday and <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/4YV4G" target="_blank" rel="noopener">normally costs $7 a month or $70 a year</a>.</p>
<p>Now, as is often the case with mobile carrier promos, there's some <a href="https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/disney-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fine print to sort through</a>. To get the free year of service, you need to subscribe to one of the carrier's Verizon Unlimited, Go Unlimited, Beyond Unlimited, Above Unlimited, Get More Unlimited, Do More Unlimited, Pay More Unlimited, or Start Unlimited plans. (If you're marveling at the fact that Verizon has had this many unlimited plans, many of which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/06/verizons-new-95-unlimited-plan-offers-at-least-75gb-of-high-speed-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren't actually unlimited</a>, you're not alone.) Both new and existing subscribers are eligible; Verizon has options on its promo page for existing subscribers who wish to switch to an unlimited plan and those who wish to move over from another carrier.</p>
<p>The offer is <a href="https://www.verizon.com/support/residential/account/manage-service/disney-redemption-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also available</a> to Verizon Fios home Internet users and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/verizon-plans-5g-home-internet-in-every-city-where-it-deploys-mobile-5g/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handful of people</a> who can access its 5G Home plan, but only if you're a new subscriber, not if you have currently pay for one of those services. For Fios users, you'll need a standalone Internet plan of at least 50/50 Mbps service, a two-year "Triple Play" bundle, or a 2-year Internet + TV "Double Play" bundle. Either way, all of this has you sign up for Disney+ through Verizon, not Disney.</p>
<p>Some items worth noting: it's possible to redeem the offer through the Web or the <a href="https://twitter.com/glkcreative/status/1194253110400692225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carrier's mobile app</a>, and Verizon says the offer is not available to prepaid or business plan customers of any sort. The email address you use to register for the promo with Verizon can't already be in use by an active Disney+ account, either. If you're eligible for the free 12 months but already bought a Disney+ subscription ahead of time, though, the carrier says its promo will not replace your existing purchase; instead, that purchase will simply be paused and you can use it once the 12 months from this promotional offer have been used. (That said, we'd still advise you to keep an eye on your account and registered email address to make sure everything's managed correctly.)</p>
<p>If you're both a Verizon Wireless <em>and</em> a new Fios user, you can technically redeem the promo twice with separate email addresses and get two years of Disney+, since Verizon treats the two services as different accounts. If you didn't purchase an annual or multi-year Disney+ subscription before you redeem the offer, Verizon will automatically renew your Disney+ service at $7 a month once the promo period expires. And the carrier says the whole promo will be available until June 1, 2020.</p>
<p>Got all that? If you're not interested in Verizon, or you'd rather just wait until Disney+ sorts through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/high-demand-causes-login-problems-on-disney-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the myriad technical problems</a> it's having at launch, we also have deals on Kindle Unlimited subscriptions, robot vacuums, USB-C chargers, gaming laptops, and more.

<p>Disney's new streaming service is straining under the load as users rush to log in to the highly anticipated service on its US launch day. Frustrated users took to social media to complain about seeing "unable to connect" error screens instead of the Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar movies they were hoping for.</p>
<p>"The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our high expectations," <a href="https://twitter.com/DisneyPlusHelp/status/1194268462283018241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194268462283018241&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5mac.com%2F2019%2F11%2F12%2Funable-to-connect-to-disney%2F">Disney tweeted</a> on Tuesday morning. "We are working to quickly resolve the current user issue."</p>
<p>Disney is aiming to reshape the paid video streaming landscape with its Disney+ offering. Until now, a lot of online streaming has been done on independent services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.</p>

<p>With Disney+, Disney is seeking to cut out the middleman and stream its content directly to customers. The company's vast library of movies and television shows, bolstered by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/trump-administration-approves-potential-disneyfox-merger/">last year's acquisition</a> of 21st Century Fox, will make the service immediately attractive to millions of potential customers.</p>
<p>But of course the product will only be attractive if it works reliably. Disney is building its streaming service using technology developed by BAMTech, a company formed by Major League Baseball teams to stream baseball games. In recent years, the company has expanded to support everything from professional wrestling to HBO Now (though HBO recently <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90373706/hbos-tech-is-prepping-att-for-the-streaming-wars">cut BAMTech loose</a>).</p>
<p>Disney acquired a majority stake in the company in 2016 and started to use it for the streaming service of Disney-owned ESPN. Now it serves as the foundation for Disney+.</p>
<p>The outages come despite extensive preparations by the BAMTech team—now known as Disney Streaming Services.</p>

<p>"We’re thinking very much about" overloaded servers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20831284/disney-plus-overload-crash-hbo-now-espn-launch-day">said Michael Paull</a>, the head of Disney's streaming efforts, in an August interview with the Verge. Paull has been the head of BAMTech since 2017 and before that was a vice president at Amazon's digital video team.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, we’ve had the experience with <em>Game of Thrones, </em>we’ve had the experience of ESPN+ with the big pay-per-view events that we’re doing with UFC exclusively on our platform," Paull told the Verge in August. “We are ready. We’re spending a lot of time planning for this launch.”</p>

<p>Right around this date in 2017, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-headset-with-a-new-os-report-says/">Bloomberg reported</a> that Apple was working on a pair of augmented reality glasses for a planned 2020 launch. Now that it's late 2019, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses">The Information is reporting</a> (and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-11/apple-s-ar-push-will-start-with-ipad-and-culminate-with-glasses">Bloomberg is largely confirming</a>) that Apple is now planning to launch a combined VR/AR headset in 2022, following up with a lightweight pair of AR glasses in 2023.</p>
<p>Apple's perpetually three-or-more-years-away headset plans have "a focus on gaming, watching video and virtual meetings," Bloomberg reports, and now include a new 3D sensor that builds off of Apple's existing FaceID sensor. A 1,000-person team inside the company—reportedly led by former Dolby Labs engineer Mike Rockwell and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/apple-hires-top-virtual-and-augmented-reality-expert-ft-reports/">involving former Virginia Tech professor Doug Bowman</a>—is still reportedly working on a completely new operating system for the headset dubbed rOS (reality operating system).</p>
<p>The market for VR and AR headsets looks very different today than it did back in 2016, when reports <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/apple-hires-top-virtual-and-augmented-reality-expert-ft-reports/">first started leaking out</a> regarding Apple's plans in the space. Back then, expensive PC-tethered VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were launching to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/the-ars-review-oculus-rift-expands-pc-gaming-past-the-monitors-edge/">lot</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/htc-vive-review-you-can-now-buy-your-own-holodeck-simulator-v-1-0/">fanfare</a> but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/more-than-a-fad-vr-headset-sales-are-slowly-creeping-higher/">generally disappointing sales</a>. Today, improvements in technology have moved the focus to cheaper "all-in-one" untethered headsets like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/oculus-quest-review-2019s-best-new-gaming-system-is-wireless-affordable-vr/">$400 Oculus Quest</a>, which has <a href="https://qz.com/1739575/strong-oculus-quest-sales-boost-facebooks-non-advertising-revenue/">reportedly sold a decent-but-uninspiring 400,000 units</a> since its launch in May (a relatively poor showing when compared to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/putting-nintendo-switchs-10-million-sales-in-context/">other recent portable gaming-focused hardware</a>).</p>
<p>On the AR side, Apple's Tim Cook was largely correct <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/10/tim-cook-believes-ar-will-be-huge-but-dont-expect-apple-glasses-yet/">when he said back in 2017</a> that "the technology itself doesn't exist to do that in a quality way." Since then, AR has remained a pricey <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/microsofts-hololens-2-tracks-your-eyeballs-to-see-what-youre-looking-at/">enterprise-focused market</a>. Bulky headsets from Microsoft and Magic Leap run for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/magic-leap-opens-orders-for-2300-creator-edition-ar-headset/">thousands</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/microsofts-hololens-2-tracks-your-eyeballs-to-see-what-youre-looking-at/">dollars</a> and still have important limitations in field-of-view and image solidity. And while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/06/arkit-2-why-apple-keeps-pushing-ar-and-how-it-works-in-ios-12/">Apple's ARKit API</a> has helped integrate augmented reality into many iOS apps, using such technology on a headset is very different from doing so by holding a phone or tablet as a "magic window" in front of your face.</p>
<p>An additional three or four years of technological advancement could bring more significant changes to the space, especially with Apple's considerable R&amp;D muscle involved. But the market for both VR and AR headsets seems unlikely to mature much past the niche stage without some major advances in both software appeal, hardware form factor, and total price. We look forward to hearing more in two years, when Apple will probably be pushing its headset launch plans back to 2024, if current patterns hold.</p>

		<title>Sonic the Hedgehog’s movie look is fixed following fan outcry</title>

          A side-by-side comparison of Sonic from the first trailer (left) and the new one (right) shows the character has been completely re-rendered.                       [credit:
                        Paramount/Sega                        ]

<p>In early May, the first trailer for the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movie was released to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/after-trailer-outcry-sonic-the-hedgehog-director-tells-fans-to-expect-changes/">almost universal criticism</a>. The problem was, Sonic just looked… terrifying. Instead of the adorable16-bit hero most of us remember, this CGI Sonic was all wrong. His legs were weirdly tapered, and the body proportions were wrong, with perhaps the worst bit being that nightmare of mouth, full of teeth.</p>
<p>The backlash was immediate (and well-founded) and heard remarkably quickly. Within two days the film's director Jeff Fowler announced that changes would be made before the film's release, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/friday-in-nerd-film-news-sonic-delayed-to-fix-its-vfx-star-wars-kotor-rumors/">a date that soon slipped</a> to February 2020—presumably once the scope of the work set in. On Tuesday, the extent of that became clear with the release of a new trailer for the movie, featuring a much-improved render of the main character.</p>
<p>The human body proportions are a thing of the past; now Sonic's feet are big and his ankles are implausibly wider than his thighs. His torso has shrunk, particularly at the waist, and his hands are now massive and once again clad in the proper white gloves. Our hedgehog's head has swelled, as have his eyes, and when he opens his mouth I no longer want to shriek in horror until professionals come and sedate me.</p>
<p>Those changes are all in line with the wishes of members of Sonic's original Japanese development team, and we think most sentient beings would agree that they're a vast improvement on what we saw earlier this year.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Amazon has suffered a setback in its own backyard as several candidates for Seattle's City Council <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/amazon-lost-the-seattle-city-council-elections-after-a-1-million-power-play-will-it-see-a-new-head-tax/">won election</a> despite a $1.5 million campaign by business groups to defeat them. That included Kshama Sawant, an incumbent and socialist who has been a thorn in Amazon's side in recent years. The vote was held last Tuesday, but the results only became clear in recent days.</p>
<p>The result is significant for Amazon because last year Seattle's city council passed a $275 per employee tax on large employers. Amazon, Starbucks, and other large Seattle businesses <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/15/news/companies/starbucks-seattle-head-tax/index.html">blasted the law</a> and funded a ballot measure to overturn it. Facing the threat of having their law overturned by voters, the city council itself <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-seattle-tax/seattle-city-council-repeals-head-tax-weeks-after-enactment-idUSKBN1J82UB">repealed the measure</a> a month after it passed.</p>

<p>If business groups had defeated pro-tax candidates in last week's election, it would have made the city council very reluctant to consider taxing employers again. Instead, the election results have emboldened supporters of an "Amazon tax."</p>
<p>The most significant race was probably the re-election of Sawant. Business groups spent $617,592 backing her opponent, Egan Orion, according to a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/amazon-lost-the-seattle-city-council-elections-after-a-1-million-power-play-will-it-see-a-new-head-tax/">Seattle Times analysis</a>. But Sawant won anyway by a margin of 51.6 percent to 48 percent.</p>
<p>"I look forward to working with the new City Council to urgently pass a strong tax," Sawant said in a Saturday news conference. She envisions using the proceeds to provide social services—including better care for the homeless.</p>
<h2>Housing shortage drives backlash</h2>
<p>Support for a tax on Amazon and other large businesses has grown as Seattle's economy has boomed. The growth of Amazon, Microsoft, and other big companies has created a crisis in the Seattle housing market as housing construction has failed to keep pace with soaring demand. As a result, young people—even those with decent incomes—have struggled to afford housing. Homelessness is a growing concern.</p>
<p>The obvious objection to taxing companies based on their headcount is that it would discourage companies from hiring more workers. In most cities, job creation is widely viewed as a positive. But things look a bit different given Seattle's dysfunctional housing market. Job creation will draw more people to the region, worsening the area's housing-affordability problem.</p>
<p>So the best way for Amazon and other big Seattle businesses to quell rising hostility would be to find ways to reform the region's housing laws to allow more housing to be constructed. That would bring down rents in the region and restore the normal rules of politics—where creating jobs is widely seen as a good thing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2019/01/16/microsoft-commits-500-million-to-tackle-affordable-housing-crisis-in-puget-sound-region/">Microsoft announced</a> that it was spending $500 million to promote housing construction in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Silicon Valley companies are dealing with an even more severe case of the same problem.

<p>Hurricanes are fed by warm ocean waters, so it's expected that we'll see larger, more dangerous storms as the planet continues to heat up due to climate change. These storms also have a major economic impact—Katrina is thought to have knocked a full percentage off the US' GDP in 2005. As such, we might expect to see hurricane-driven economic damages to be increasing over time.</p>
<p>But there's a lot of statistical noise in that system. Many storms miss the US entirely, and others miss the major urban centers and damage sparsely populated areas. The growth of wealth over time, as well as things like changing business codes, also complicate the analysis. As a result, detecting any change in damages is extremely difficult, and studies have come to very different conclusions about whether there's a trend or not.</p>
<p>But a new study suggests that the most powerful storms are in fact increasing. And perhaps just as significantly, its findings are consistent with a study of natural disasters published just a month ago, even though the two used very different methods.</p>
<h2>Hurricanes and other disasters</h2>
<p>We went over all the reasons that measuring trends in natural disasters is complicated when we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/extreme-disasters-costing-more-but-killing-fewer/">covered a study on the topic</a> last month. Rather than reiterate that, we're going to focus on contrasting the methods that paper used with those that this week's study relied on.</p>

<p>The study published last month was on weather-related natural disasters in general; it included hurricanes but also events like droughts and heat waves. It adjusted for the changing demographics of locations struck by disasters by accounting for things like the population and GDP of the areas affected by the disaster. These showed a clear trend when it came to the most costly disasters: there are more of them than a century ago, and some are costing more than any we saw earlier, even after economic growth is accounted for.</p>
<p>This week's study, in contrast, focuses on hurricanes. Again, it compensates for things like the local population and its economic activity. But it does so by a distinct method, combining data on the storm's location and its damages to calculate what the authors term an "area of total destruction." This measure accounts for the wealth of the area struck by the hurricane by normalizing it to a ratio calculated by comparing the value of what was actually destroyed to what potentially could have been destroyed. This was calculated for a 10,000-square-kilometer area surrounding the storm's landfall location, based on the size of recent large storms.</p>
<p>Thus, although the two studies are similar in terms of the analysis they want to perform, their particular approaches are distinct.</p>
<p>Despite this, the result of the new analysis is similar to that of the earlier one. Two trends were apparent. The first is that the overall destructiveness of hurricanes has been climbing slowly over the last century. The second trend is that the most destructive storms are increasing in destructiveness faster than the less harmful ones. For example, moderately destructive storms have increased in destructiveness by about 1.5-fold from 1900 to the 2010s. By contrast, the most destructive storms have increased by 3.3-fold.</p>
<p>The authors also went back and re-analyzed the data used to conclude that there was no statistically significant overall trend when economic growth was adjusted for using a different method. Even in this data, they were able to see that the most destructive events had increased by a statistically significant amount—3.2-fold in this case, not significantly different from what they saw in their own analysis.</p>
<p>It also agrees with the earlier analysis, which also saw that changes in the cost of natural disasters were being driven by the largest events.</p>
<h2>Replication and independence</h2>
<p>The authors acknowledge that their work is a first attempt and could be improved upon significantly. The study simply takes a large area surrounding the hurricane's site of landfall and assumes that this area is big enough to have a GDP similar to that of the US as a whole. It's possible to get better regional measures of GDP and to track the path of a storm and the radius of its winds. But that sort of data isn't available for the earlier storms in this data set, which may limit the analysis to a shorter time period.</p>
<p>But even in its current form, the study is interesting because of how it fits in with the other literature on the topic. It sees the same trends in hurricanes that people have found for weather-driven disasters in general. And the same effect can be seen if a different method is used to compensate for economic growth. All of which helps provide a bit more confidence in the results.</p>
<p>The ability to produce consistent results using different methods is often a critical way that scientists end up replicating a finding and occurs far more often than we see in direct repetitions of the same experiments. Which is why the focus on directly repeating identical experiments that has accompanied the talk of a "replication crisis" seems somewhat off target. In many ways, repeating an experiment and not getting the same result tells us far less about what's going on than having looked at the same problem from multiple angles.</p>

<p>Almost two-thirds of Americans agree that the space program's costs are justified. And fewer think that NASA's budget should be reduced or abolished than at any time since 1986. Those were two of the results from <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/260309/years-moon-landing-support-space-program-high.aspx">polling conducted by Gallup</a> for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing. The poll found a clear upward trend for support for space exploration, starting at 41% in 1979 and rising to 64% by 2019.</p>
<p>But much less is known about <em>why</em> different Americans are in favor of space exploration. That would be useful information for policymakers—of all stripes—who hope to convince the public to open their wallets. It's a question that David Burbach, a political scientist at the US Naval War College in Rhode Island, has sought to answer in a new study published in the journal Space Policy.</p>
<h2>Crossed priorities</h2>
<p>Previous work has identified demographic or social differences in public support for the space program. Being young, white, male, or more highly educated all correlate with greater support for NASA than being older, non white, female, or having a lower educational attainment. Evangelical Christians are more lukewarm on the idea than the rest of the nation, but as it turns out <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2015/07/2015-07-01_science-and-politics_FINAL-1.pdf">there's not much of a split</a> between Republican and Democratic voters on the topic.</p>
<p>The 2018 Pew survey we mentioned above found that even though public support for NASA is strong, the agency's priorities aren't shared by the public. NASA is focused on crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/nasas-priorities-appear-to-be-out-of-whack-with-what-the-public-wants/">the public overwhelmingly wants</a> the agency to monitor our climate and defend us from killer asteroids.</p>

<p>The problem facing anyone trying to assign motives for the support for the space program is that you have to ask them the right question in order to get their feelings. Unfortunately, while public attitudes toward the space program have been polled since the dawn of the space age, motivations have not been well explored. So Burbach set out to find the answers another way, correlating opinions on space program spending with other, better-studied attitudes, like those toward the military or the environment. If, for example, there's a weak correlation between supporting space exploration and defense spending among Democrats, that could be useful information when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/a-house-budget-committee-has-likely-killed-the-2024-moon-landing/">proposing an increase in NASA's budget to the House of Representatives</a>.</p>
<p>Burbach's data set comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Social_Survey">General Social Survey</a>, which has polled Americans since 1972, at first annually and later every other year. Overall, this study includes about 62,000 cumulative respondents from 1973 to 2016. Using that data, he looked at correlations between support for funding the space program and funding the military, funding for the environment, funding for social programs, and finally with "confidence in science." He then looked to see if those correlations differed by political affiliation.</p>
<h2>Small trends</h2>
<p>Although there is a link between political affiliation and support for the space program, it's small. Once other variables have been controlled, "the model predicts a Democrat would have a 10 percent probability of wanting greater spending, and a Republican would have a 14 percent probability." As expected, Americans who supported higher military spending also favored more space funding. There was even higher support for increasing space funding among respondents who had high confidence in science, and a small but positive correlation between support for the environment and space funding.</p>
<p>When Burbach added party affiliation to the analysis, the differences turned out to be pretty minor. Republicans who support the space program are less likely to support welfare spending, and Democrats and independents who support the environment are slightly more likely to support the space program. Burbach didn't see the expected negative correlation between space and social funding among Democrats.</p>
<p>Next, Burbach looked at how those various correlations have trended over time. The demographic splits identified earlier have narrowed since 1973, thanks to increasing support for the space program among women and non-whites. The gap in support between different levels of academic achievement has narrowed most significantly since the 1970s. But the trends within each party group are much smaller.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, Democrats who support space funding have become a little less supportive of military spending and a little more supportive of environmental spending. But the trends for Republicans and these two categories have been flat. And both Democrats and Republicans who support space funding have become more supportive of social spending. Finally, support for space funding has grown among Democrats who have confidence in science, but not among Republicans.</p>
<p>In such contentious times, it's good to see that one's political biases have such a minor effect on support for space. However, Burbach cautions that framing support for space exploration as a national security issue for Republicans and an environmental one for Democrats may lead to trouble down the road if "negative partisanship"—opposing something because your political opponents support it—takes effect.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/we-now-know-what-disney-will-look-like-plus-a-few-new-exclusive-series/">Disney+ debuts today</a> with a <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/1305166/707638/9358?subId1=DisneyPlusMandalorian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthy slew of classic films and new series</a>, its biggest day-one draw has to be Star Wars' first live-action TV series, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/disney-announces-new-star-wars-trilogy-live-action-tv-series/"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>. Ahead of its launch, we wondered how well the show, about a bounty hunter living in the era between Episodes <em>VI</em> and <em>VIII</em>, might <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/space-cowboy-successes-and-failures-ahead-of-the-mandalorians-disney-launch/">lean into the archetype of space westerns</a>. Today, we now know that this is a full yee-haw and yippy-ki-yay of a gunslinging time with a new, faceless, grizzled anti-hero.</p>
<p>Even better, by the first episode's end, the reveal of his surprising journey had me shouting a hearty "whaaaaat?!" It's been a while since a TV series pilot has had me this excited.</p>
<p><em>This review of the series' pilot episode contains mild plot spoilers—and errs on the side of vague descriptions.</em></p>
<h2>"Pre-Empire?"</h2>
<p>The titular star of <em>The Mandalorian</em> (Pedro Pascal) first appears in this series in traditional western fashion: in the middle of an average day's work. For this renowned bounty hunter, that means kicking butts and picking up wanted goons.</p>
<p>We meet the Mandalorian, who isn't referred to by any other name, in mostly silent fashion. He has little to say to drunken bullies at a bar, nor to the patron he's there to meet (and escort far, far away). This opening sequence comes with a nearly pitch-perfect comedic touch, thanks both to a blue-collar, blue-skinned criminal (played by <em>SNL</em>'s Horatio Sanz) and a confused ferry handler (played by comedian and famed Star Wars super-geek Brian Posehn).</p>
<p>That comedic touch is crucial, because the Mandalorian opts for the silent-and-stoic approach when peppered with questions. "She's classic!" Sanz's alien character says about the Mandalorian's crusty spaceship. "Pre-Empire?" The bounty hunter stares forward in response, his helmet shining with the slight glow of whatever nearby star is visible through the cockpit. That's the point. We as viewers sit uncomfortably with this silence, taking in the fact that this series takes place after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi</em>. What life is there for a bounty hunter in such an era?</p>
<p>Sure enough, when the Mandalorian cashes in his latest bounties, he's nearly paid by his handler (Greef Carga, played by Carl Weathers) in worthless Empire currency. The pesky roster of newly available jobs aren't even worth the cost of gas, Mandalorian complains, to which Greef replies: Well, there <em>is</em> one job...</p>
<p>After an awkward meeting with a mysterious handler (Werner Herzog), who hides in a basement bunker with an army of Stormtroopers, the Mandalorian finds himself set up with a new gig, complete with unclear coordinates and a ludicrously high payment. This new "client' doesn't have much in the way of demands beyond one request: that his bounty be brought in "alive," If possible.</p>
<h2>"I've only heard the stories"</h2>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Screenshot-1898-980x551.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          The Mandalorian arrives at work.                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>This 40-minute pilot episode is careful to surround the Mandalorian with chatty characters, though the opening emphasis on humor is notably dialed back after the first 10 minutes. This tactic pays off pretty handsomely, in part because we see the show's "what's going on" explanations come organically from characters like Greef and "the client." After this, we get a pretty nifty point of contrast. The Mandalorian's eventual landing on a new planet—massive, mostly deserted, covered in sand dunes, yep, it's a Star Wars character origin story—begins with a crisis. The Mandalorian gets into some heat, and the person who saves him (a pig-nosed humanoid alien, played by Nick freakin' Nolte) winds up being even <em>more</em> stoic and reserved.</p>
<p>Thus, we get to see our anti-hero poke out of his guarded shell, however briefly, in search of knowledge and context for why he's being helped. Not only do we get a brief hint of his character's humanity, we also see Nolte earn his paycheck as a ridiculous curmudgeon of a character—and one who drops some massive wisdom about our story's hero, and his foretold reputation, in a powerful, blink-and-you'll-miss-it dollop.</p>
<p>At this point, we see the Mandalorian overcome some odds, curry Nolte's favor, and make his way to a heavily guarded compound. Pardon the mini-spoiler here, but Taika Waititi shows up as the voice of a surprise-appearance droid who ruins the Mandalorian's stakeout, and he has to contend with the fallout. This is the pilot episode's purest western moment: a laser saloon shoutout, by golly, and it shines thanks to silly Mandalorian-and-droid chatter and a ramp-up of heavy-duty weaponry.</p>
<p>After that, well... I'm not saying a single specific thing, except that my Star Wars-loving self was caught off guard by the episode-clinching twist, which had me foaming at the mouth for what's to come next.</p>
<h2>Careful costumes, comedic CGI</h2>
<p>Yet even if you take the moment in question and drop it into our comment section (please don't, at least not without spoiler tags), that single statement wouldn't do enough to sum up what makes me eager for next week's episode to drop. (If you're wondering: Disney+ is opting for a one-episode-per-week launch schedule at this point, with no confirmed episode schedule available just yet; sorry if you thought you had a full <em>Mandalorian</em> binge ahead of you.) Rather, the production crew, led by <em>Iron Man</em> and <em>Swingers</em> Director Jon Favreau, seems to really understand what makes a seedy Star Wars story worth following.</p>
<p>I loved the balance of practical effects, carefully molded alien costumes, and intentionally cheeseball CGI. You'll see our hero ride a digital alien as a mount at one point, and the low-budget bounce of this creature over hills and valleys feels delightfully animated, not obnoxiously cheap. Those brief CGI moments are forgivable in light of gorgeous set design, a John Williams-caliber score of brand-new compositions, and a cast of actors who savor their pauses, beats, and moments to simmer in tension (both for action and comedy's sake). Not only did I have fun, I was shocked to see the episode's 40 minutes practically melt in a snap.</p>
<p>If the pilot is any indication, <em>The Mandalorian</em> is Star Wars for a generation of fans who remember the film series as an aesthetic, an ethos, and a promise of morally mixed discovery. And I'm already ready to hitch my space western wagon to this wild ride.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Google quietly partnered last year with Ascension—the country's second-largest health system—and has since gained access to detailed medical records on tens of millions of Americans, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790?shareToken=st98ed7303aedb45d281bc0bda02eb90b4">according to a November 11 report by The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>The endeavor, code-named "Project Nightingale," has enabled at least 150 Google employees to see patient health information, which includes diagnoses, laboratory test results, hospitalization records, and other data, according to internal documents and the newspaper's sources. In all, the data amounts to complete medical records, WSJ notes, and contains patient names and birth dates.</p>
<p>The move is the latest by Google to get a grip on the sprawling health industry. At the start of the month, Google announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/google-buys-fitbit-for-2-1-billion/">a deal to buy Fitbit</a>, prompting concerns over what it will do with all the sensitive health data amassed from the popular wearables. Today's news will likely spur more concern over health privacy issues.</p>
<p>Neither Google nor Ascension has notified patients or doctors about the data sharing. Ascension—a Catholic, non-profit health system—includes 34,000 providers who see patients at more than 2,600 hospitals, doctor offices, and other facilities across 21 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The massive data-sharing project with Google has multiple objectives. For Google's part, the company is developing new software that employs artificial intelligence and machine learning to make care suggestions for individual patients. Google's ultimate goal is to develop a searchable, cloud-based tool to host and examine massive amounts of patient data—which it could then market to other health systems.</p>
<p>Ascension aims, in part, to improve patient care with the project. Internal documents seen by WSJ indicate that Ascension also hopes that the Google-mining will help identify additional ways to generate revenue from patients, such as ordering more medical tests.</p>
<h2>Transforming care</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ascension.org/News/News-Articles/2019/11/11/19/51/Ascension-and-Google-working-together-on-healthcare-transformation">In a statement</a>, Ascension Executive Vice President of Strategy and Innovations Eduardo Conrado said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the healthcare environment continues to rapidly evolve, we must transform to better meet the needs and expectations of those we serve as well as our own caregivers and healthcare providers. Doing that will require the programmatic integration of new care models delivered through the digital platforms, applications, and services that are part of the everyday experience of those we serve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tariq Shaukat, president of Google Cloud, added in the statement that, by working in partnerships, Google hopes "to transform the delivery of healthcare through the power of the cloud, data analytics, machine learning, and modern productivity tools—ultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs, and saving lives."</p>
<p>Both Google and Ascension said that the project is compliant with federal health information privacy protections and is "underpinned by a robust data security and protection effort."</p>
<p>Health privacy experts told WSJ that the project appears to be legal under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). As the newspaper notes, the law "generally allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used 'only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.'"</p>

(credit: <a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-card/">Apple</a>)</p>  </figure>






<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Apple launched its own branded MasterCard nationwide <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/apple-card-is-now-available-to-all-us-iphone-owners-adds-new-cash-back-rewards/">in August</a>. In the months since, the digital-first payment system has won some fans for its easy integration into the iPhone and Apple ecosystem, and it more or less seemed to work about as well as any other credit card. Now, however, financial-services regulators want to know what's going on under the hood amid accusations that the software determining the card's terms has a sexist slant.</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>Software developer and entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192540900393705474?s=20">took to Twitter</a> late last week to complain about his wife Jamie Heinemeier Hansson's experience with AppleCard. </p>
<p>"The @AppleCard is such a fucking sexist program," his lengthy thread began. "My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community-property state, and have been married for a long time. Yet Apple's black box algorithm thinks I deserve 20x the credit limit she does. No appeals work."</p>
<p>"It gets even worse," he added, sharing a <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1192541763296276494">screenshot</a> showing $0 owed on a limit of, apparently, $57.24. "Even when she pays off her ridiculously low limit in full, the card won't approve any spending until the next billing period. Women apparently aren't good credit risks even when they pay off the fucking balance in advance and in full."</p>
<p>Speaking with Apple customer service did no good, he added, with representatives repeatedly deflecting blame to the black box that makes the determinations. Customer service representatives were, "very nice, courteous people representing an utterly broken and reprehensible system," Hansson said. "The first person was like 'I don't know why, but I swear we're not discriminating, IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM.' I shit you not. 'IT'S JUST THE ALGORITHM!'"</p>
<p>Several other men on Twitter chimed in with replies outlining similar experiences. They said their wives, who on paper look like the better credit risks, received significantly less favorable terms on their Apple Cards than they did. One of the responses came from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who <a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193330241478901760">tweeted</a> that, although he and his wife have only joint bank accounts and assets, his Apple Card was given a limit 10 times higher than his wife's.</p>
<p>As Hansson's thread went viral and gained media attention, representatives of Apple VIP customer service stepped in. They bumped the credit limit on Jamie's card up to match David's and launched an internal investigation.</p>
<h2>External investigation</h2>
<p>Apple VIP support aren't the only ones interested in figuring out if the company's mysterious algorithm is behaving in discriminatory ways; regulators are investigating now, too.</p>
<p>Hansson's tweets drew the attention of Linda Lacewell, head of the New York Department of Financial Services. "Here in New York State, we support innovation," Lacewell wrote in <a href="https://medium.com/@nydfs/building-a-fairer-and-more-inclusive-financial-services-industry-for-everyone-917183dae954">a blog post</a> Sunday, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, new technologies cannot leave certain consumers behind or entrench discrimination. We believe innovation can help solve many challenges, including making quality financial services more accessible and affordable. Yet, this can't be accomplished without maintaining public confidence. For innovation to deliver lasting and sustained value, the consumers who use new products or services must be able to trust they are being treated fairly.</p></blockquote>
<p>All financial products and services offered in New York State are required not to discriminate against protected groups. Those products include the Apple Card, which is backed by New York-based Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs issued a <a href="https://twitter.com/gsbanksupport/status/1193703266003177472?s=21">statement</a> Sunday saying the discrepancies happened because credit decisions are made on an individual basis, not taking family factors into account.</p>
<p>"We look at an individual's income and an individual's creditworthiness, which includes factors like personal credit scores, how much debt you have, and how that debt has been managed," the company said. "Based on these factors, it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions. In all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender."</p>
<p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/goldman-wants-to-fix-the-apple-card-flaw-that-has-users-claiming-bias.html">reports</a> that Goldman was "aware of the potential issue" before the card launched in August but chose to move forward anyway. The bank says it is still considering ways of launching shared accounts, including adding multiple cardholders to a single account or allowing for co-signers.</p>
<p>The statement (and the potential for joint accounts or co-signers) does not specifically address why several users reported their wives—in some cases literal millionaires—were given significantly lower Apple Card credit limits and higher interest rates despite being the higher-income earners in the family, having higher credit scores, or both.</p>
<h2>Unintended consequences</h2>
<p>It's unlikely in the extreme that someone at either Apple or Goldman Sachs sat down, twirled his mustache à la Snidely Whiplash, and said, "Ah ha! Let's treat women more badly than men!" Doing so would be both morally and economically stupid, and nobody's accusing the companies of doing it intentionally.</p>
<p>Decisions made by algorithm, though, have a way of reflecting good old-fashioned human biases—just with even less transparency. And it happens in almost every field. The examples are becoming countless.</p>
<p>About a year ago, Amazon had to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G">stop using an AI tool</a> for hiring and recruiting purposes after it turned out not to be advancing female candidates. Essentially, the software looked at the company's current successful workforce, which skews male, and decided "male" must be a determinant of success. </p>
<p>In 2015, ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/asians-nearly-twice-as-likely-to-get-higher-price-from-princeton-review">discovered</a> that Asian American families were likely to be charged significantly more for SAT test-prep services. The algorithm determining price wasn't built expressly to discriminate by race; instead, it used ZIP code—but it charged higher rates in neighborhoods that turned out to be predominantly Asian.</p>
<p>Algorithms with systemic biases are also pervasive in the criminal justice system, where math tends to assign black criminals a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">higher chance of recidivism</a> after serving their terms than white criminals, as well as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/algorithms-should-have-made-courts-more-fair-what-went-wrong/">higher cash bail</a>, despite evidence showing the scores are unreliable and often wrong.</p>
<p>"The formula was particularly likely to falsely flag black defendants as future criminals, wrongly labeling them this way at almost twice the rate as white defendants," ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">wrote</a> in 2016. "White defendants were mislabeled as low risk more often than black defendants."</p>
<h2>High-profile luck</h2>
<p>The Hanssons are lucky in several ways. First, they're at about the highest end of the consumer spectrum. Jamie wrote in a <a href="https://dhh.dk/2019/about-the-apple-card.html">statement</a> today that she has been financially successful, independent of her husband, for a number of years. She does currently hold a full-time job outside of the home while caring for their three children, she said, but "I am still a millionaire who contributes greatly to my household and pays off credit in full each month." Both Hanssons have also repeatedly said in public that her credit score is not only excellent but also higher than his.</p>
<p>Beyond that, David has a high profile in the tech and business worlds, with lots of acquaintances and allies in all the right places and more than 350,000 Twitter followers. He can make a stink that will be both seen and taken seriously. The Apple Card is a luxury good, and the Hanssons got such a strong response, in short, because they have just about every privilege in the book—and they're both keenly aware of it.</p>
<p>"This situation... does not matter for my livelihood," Jamie wrote in her statement, acknowledging, "This is not merely a story about sexism and credit algorithm blackboxes, but about how rich people nearly always get their way. Justice for another rich white woman is not justice at all."</p>
<p>Instead of being about her specifically, she wrote, it's the principle of the thing: "We cannot bow down to the algorithms. We cannot keep sliding into a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/review-black-mirror-s5-doesnt-quite-capture-the-magic-of-earlier-seasons/"><em>Black Mirror</em></a> world. Apple can and should be better than this. We should all be better than this."</p>
<p>"I hear the frustration of women and minorities who have already been beating this drum loudly and publicly for years without this level of attention," she added. "I didn't wish to be the subject matter that sparked these fires, but I'm glad they're blazing."</p>

<p>Major publishers Capcom and EA are also absent from Stadia's current planned 2019 lineup, though both were listed as participating in Stadia's "launch window" as recently as August. Google has not yet responded to a request for comment on those omissions. [Update: A Google spokesperson told Ars that "'launch window' conveyed the first few months after launch.  What we announced today was the first 6 weeks."]</p>
<p>A handful of other unreleased titles that were promised for the Stadia launch window have simply been delayed into 2020. Those include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></li>

<p>Of the 26 titles planned for Stadia release this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/get-ready-to-jump-in-the-stream-for-google-stadias-exclusive-games/">Tequila Works' horror game <em>Gylt</em></a> is the only one that won't be available on other platforms concurrently (though Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/google-wants-stadia-exclusives-that-are-not-possible-on-any-other-platform/">an internal development studio working on more exclusives</a> in the coming months and years). <em>Darksiders: Genesis</em> is due to launch simultaneously on PC and Stadia on December 5.</p>
<p>Looking at the 24 remaining 2019 Stadia games, 15 were first released on other platforms sometime in 2019, and five more were first released in 2018. The list of 2018 releases includes <em>Farming Simulator 19</em>, even though an updated "2020" version of the franchise is due for release on other platforms December 3. And while <em>Football Manager 2020</em> will also be launching on other platforms November 19, developer Sports Interactive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/developer-says-stadia-will-have-the-fastest-version-of-football-manager/">has said</a> the Stadia version will offer "the fastest way to experience <em>Football Manager" </em>thanks to Google's cloud data centers.</p>
<p>At launch, Stadia is only available <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/google-stadia-requires-130-upfront-10-per-month-at-november-launch/">via the purchase of a $130 bundle</a> that includes a Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra for TV play.

		<title>Guests get more than they bargained for in trailer for Fantasy Island reboot</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[





<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a6O30nJ02PU?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Michael Peña and Lucy Hale star in Sony Picture Entertainment’s <em>Fantasy Island.</em> </p></div>
<p>Ze plane! Ze plane! OK, there's no Tattoo, but the mysterious Mr. Roarke is still offering select guests a rare opportunity to make their dreams come true in Sony Pictures' big-screen reboot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Island_(film)"><em>Fantasy Island</em></a>, based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Island">popular TV series</a> of the same name that ran from 1977-1984. This 21st-century update plays up the horror aspects and is being touted as a cross between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/westworld/"><em>Westworld</em></a> and <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em>—perhaps with a little bit of <em>Lost</em> thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><em>Fantasy Island</em> was always kind of a terrific storytelling concept, despite its cheesier elements. Apparently, creator Aaron Spelling pitched the series to ABC executives <a href="https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/aaron-spelling#">as a joke</a> after they'd rejected all his other ideas—and the network loved the idea. The ultra-urbane Ricardo Montalban played the dashing Mr. Roarke, proprietor of the titular island, providing guests the chance to live out their fantasies for a suitable price. He was aided by his trusty sidekick Tattoo (Hervé Villechaize). Every episode opened with Tattoo shouting the catchphrase, "Ze plane! Ze plane!" and ringing a bell in the island's main tower as guests arrived.</p>
<p>There were usually two to three subplots per episode, focusing on the different fantasies of specific guests, who inevitably found things did not play out quite the way they'd imagined. And while the rules of engagement held that guests must see their fantasies through to the end, no matter what, Mr. Roarke always intervened if things got too dangerous. The series had certain supernatural elements (time travel was common, and ghosts, genies, and the devil himself made appearances), particularly in later seasons, with hints that Mr. Roarke was quite possibly immortal. Spelling has never revealed anything about the character, but Montalban later admitted that he viewed Mr. Roarke as a fallen angel presiding over an island purgatory. That would explain his fondness for moralizing and teaching guests a valuable lesson by fulfilling their fantasies in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_Island_(1998_TV_series)">attempted revival</a> of the series in 1998 leaned even harder into the supernatural aspects. It starred Malcolm McDowell as Mr. Roarke, aided by a female shapeshifter named Ariel (Mädchen Amick) and his adoptive daughter Miranda—obvious allusions to Shakespeare's <em>The Tempest</em>. Fantasy Island was presented as a kind of limbo and a source for Mr. Roarke's supernatural powers, while the many assistants worked there to pay off some unnamed debt. That reboot bombed and was mercifully canceled midseason.</p>

<p>This latest reboot seems to preserve much of the original premise—with a twist. Per the official synopsis: "The enigmatic Mr. Roarke (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pe%C3%B1a">Michael Peña</a>), makes the secret dreams of his lucky guests come true at a luxurious but remote tropical resort. But when the fantasies turn into nightmares, the guests have to solve the island’s mystery in order to escape with their lives." Maybe there are shades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game"><em>The Most Dangerous Game</em></a> here as well. The tagline is "You deserve it," so the moralizing aspect is probably intact, too.</p>
<p>The trailer opens, per tradition, with guests arriving via plane to the island and being greeted by an as-yet-unnamed host, played by Parisa Fitz-Henley (best known as Luke Cage's deceased wife in Netflix's <em>Defenders</em> series). "Here, anything and everything is possible," she tells the guests, although it doesn't take long for Melanie (Lucy Hale) to complain about the lack of cell phone service. She's also convinced that the "fantasies" are created using realistic holograms, "like Tupac."</p>
<p>Roarke greets his guests and outlines the rules: "There is only one fantasy per guest, and you must see your fantasy through. No matter what."</p>
<p>One of the guests, played by Maggie Q, is a grieving mother longing to be reunited with her dead daughter—and it seems Roarke has indeed managed to bring the little girl back to life, or something so like her, her own mother can't tell the difference. Another guest seems to find himself in a soldier-of-fortune/military-type fantasy. But it's Melanie's fantasy that is the main focus here: taking revenge on the girl who bullied her in school. She finds herself in a dungeon with said bully tied to a chair, ready for torture, but soon realizes it is not a hologram. That's really the girl who bullied her, and there's a creepy masked Surgeon (Ian Roberts) standing by to inflict unspeakable torments.</p>
<p>It's the ultimate fulfillment of the adage "Be careful what you wish for." As one male guest complains, "The island's twisting what we asked for." And our grieving mother notes, "We weren't brought here to have our own fantasies. We were brought here to be a part of something else." Forget about escaping the island by plane: we see it explode in mid-air upon approach. Who will solve the puzzle and make it off alive?</p>
<p><em>Fantasy Island</em> hits theaters on February 14, 2020.</p>

<p>As a case involving Comcast and an African American-owned TV network operator heads to the US Supreme Court, a daughter of Martin Luther King Jr. has accused Comcast of trying to "dismantle" the Civil Rights Act of 1866.</p>
<p>Bernice King, MLK's daughter and CEO of the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, wrote an <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKingCenter/status/1193365111093780480">open letter</a> to Comcast CEO Brian Roberts on Friday. She wrote that Comcast's argument at the Supreme Court would change the law to let businesses discriminate based on race.</p>
<p>"To alter the Act to accommodate discrimination against people based on race would reverse precarious progress in the freedom struggle, which my father was assassinated for leading and which my mother continued to join others in leading until her death," King wrote. She also told Roberts that "Comcast's ongoing pursuit to effectively dismantle a fundamental America[n] anti-discrimination law may be the legacy history forever associates [with] the company and your legacy of leadership."</p>

<p>— The King Center (@TheKingCenter) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKingCenter/status/1193365111093780480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>King's letter pertains to a lawsuit filed against Comcast by Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios Networks (ESN), which claimed that Comcast's refusal to carry ESN channels was racially motivated and seeks a $20 billion judgment. Allen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/charter-cant-use-1st-amendment-to-refuse-black-owned-tv-channels-court-rules/">won a key decision</a> in November 2018 at the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which ruled that the case can move forward to a trial and that a US District Court had improperly granted Comcast's motion to dismiss ESN's complaint.</p>
<p>Comcast asked the Supreme Court to take up the case, and the court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/comcasts-fight-against-racial-bias-lawsuit-is-taken-up-by-supreme-court/">agreed to do so</a>. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday this week.</p>
<p>The key question is whether Allen must prove that racism was the primary factor motivating Comcast. Comcast <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1171/91371/20190308153623647_Comcast%20-%20NAAAOM%20Petition%20TO%20PRINTER.pdf">told the Supreme Court</a> that Allen's claim must "fail in the absence of but-for causation."</p>
<p>A "but-for" test <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/but-for_test">asks</a>, "but for the existence of X, would Y have occurred?" If the but-for standard is applied, Allen's suit would fail as long as a factor other than racism can explain Comcast's refusal to pay ESN to carry its TV channels, even if there is reason to think that Comcast was also motivated by racism.</p>
<p>"As this case goes before the Supreme Court, Comcast, under your leadership, seeks a ruling requiring plaintiffs prove discrimination was the only factor in the denial of a contract," King wrote to Roberts.</p>
<p>Given that, King told Roberts that Comcast should answer the following questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Knowing that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was enacted to prohibit discrimination of any kind when making and enforcing contracts, why is Comcast relentlessly fighting for the right to avoid doing business with a person of color so long as her or his race is one of several factors for such refusal?</li>
<li>Are you prepared to say business decisions based on racism are acceptable if combined with other non-racist reasons?</li>
<li>Do you believe in your heart racism in modest doses should be permitted in American society, let alone in business contracts?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>King also said that Comcast's position in the case is at odds with its recent statement that "promoting diversity and inclusion are core objectives across our company."</p>
<h2>Pressure from lawmaker</h2>
<p>Comcast is also facing pressure from US Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/entertainment-studios-us-congressman-calls-for-breakup-of-comcast-300955139.html">told Roberts in a letter</a> that Comcast "has shown itself to be an enemy of minority communities" and that the company should be broken up.</p>
<p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People took no position on the underlying dispute between ESN and Comcast but <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/09/comcast-naacp-supreme-court-discrimination-battle-byron-allen-urban-league-1202747067/">said</a> that Comcast's legal argument would "roll back the crucial protections of one of the nation's oldest civil rights laws." Notably, the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.611173.1.0.pdf">original version</a> of ESN's lawsuit named the NAACP as a defendant along with Comcast. ESN alleged that the NAACP helped Comcast "whitewash" its discriminatory business practices by entering into a memorandum of understanding on diversity issues with the company, but the NAACP was later dropped from the case.</p>
<p>The US Department of Justice <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/08/byron-allen-comcast-civil-rights-lawsuit-supreme-court-filing-reaction-doj-donald-trump-1202671369/">supported</a> Comcast's position on but-for causation in a <a href="https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/doj-comcast-entertainment-studios-brief-wm.pdf">brief</a> to the Supreme Court. The brief said that "But-for causation is the default rule for federal anti-discrimination laws."</p>
<h2>Comcast defends legal argument and its record</h2>
<p>When contacted by Ars today, Comcast called ESN's lawsuit "frivolous" and "baseless."</p>
<p>"All we are asking is that section 1981 in our case be interpreted the same way it has been interpreted for decades across the country," Comcast said. That's a reference to <a href="https://content.next.westlaw.com/Document/I0f9fc015ef0811e28578f7ccc38dcbee/View/FullText.html">Section 1981</a> of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1981">prohibits</a> racial discrimination in contractual relationships.</p>
<p>Comcast said that the 9th Circuit decision was an "outlier," as courts have repeatedly upheld the but-for causation standard in Section 1981 cases for decades. Comcast also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have been forced to appeal this decision to defend against a meritless $20 billion claim, but have kept our argument narrowly focused. This case cannot detract from Comcast's strong civil rights and diversity record or our outstanding record of supporting and fostering diverse programming from African-American owned channels. There has been no finding of discriminatory conduct by Comcast against this plaintiff by any court, and there has been none.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comcast noted that it has reached programming deals with numerous African American-owned TV networks.</p>
<h2>Opposing arguments</h2>
<p>SCOTUSBlog <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2019/11/justices-to-consider-pleading-standard-for-federal-law-barring-discrimination-in-contracts/">published an in-depth summary</a> of Comcast and Allen's arguments last week. As detailed on SCOTUSBlog by reporter Amy Howe, a lawyer who has <a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/amy-howe">argued</a> Supreme Court cases, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 says that everyone must have the same rights as white people to make and enforce contracts. Howe summarized Comcast's argument as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the defendant would have made the same decision about whether to enter into a contract if the plaintiff had been white, Comcast reasons, then the plaintiff had the "same right" to enter into the contract. This interpretation is also consistent, Comcast suggests, with the Supreme Court's earlier cases interpreting the Civil Rights Act of 1866 as requiring the plaintiff to show that the decision in dispute was made "because of" the plaintiff's race—"language that unmistakably connotes but-for causation." Therefore, Comcast concludes, ESN's complaint must allege, and it must prove, that Comcast's decision not to enter into a contract would have been different were it not for the race of the company's owners.</p></blockquote>
<p>ESN argues that the Supreme Court in other cases endorsed a standard less stringent than "but-for causation" in Section 1981 claims.</p>
<p>"The justices have ruled that courts should use a 'burden-shifting framework,' which initially requires the plaintiff to provide evidence suggesting discrimination but then shifts the burden to the defendant to demonstrate that there is a legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason for its decision," Howe wrote. "Congress, ESN argues, tacitly approved that standard when it amended parts of the Civil Rights Act in 1991 but 'left the burden shifting holding of this decision untouched.'"</p>
<p>ESN also argued that "there was no tradition of requiring 'but for' causation in cases involving intentional torts, which are most analogous to Section 1981," SCOTUSBlog wrote. "The cases that Comcast cites, ESN points out, involve allegations that the defendant was negligent, not that the defendant acted intentionally. Its interpretation, ESN continues, is also more consistent with Congress' purpose in enacting the Civil Rights Act and Section 1981: to create a 'sweeping' bar on racial discrimination."</p>
<p>Comcast and ESN both argue that a Supreme Court ruling in the other's favor would have severe consequences. Comcast cautioned the court that if it doesn't overturn the 9th Circuit ruling, "a party may be held liable for racially discriminatory contracting—and subjected to compensatory and punitive damages—even where it would have made the same contracting decision irrespective of race."</p>
<h2>“The defendant’s motives”</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, ESN warned that a win for Comcast would prohibit a plaintiff "who alleges that race was a motivating factor for the refusal to contract" from conducting fact-finding on those claims if the plaintiff can't meet the but-for causation standard. That's difficult, ESN said, because "the defendant typically is the only party with access to evidence of the defendant's motives."</p>
<p>"Comcast's proposed pleading standard would effectively shut the door to the federal courts for African Americans and other people of color who are treated differently in contracting because of race," ESN also told the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>ESN separately filed a similar lawsuit against Charter, the second-biggest cable company in the US after Comcast. Charter's own petition to the Supreme Court is still pending, but the Supreme Court's decision on Comcast could have an impact on the Charter case. "[T]he parties anticipate the Supreme Court will hold Charter's petition in abeyance pending the disposition of the Comcast case," according to a joint status report filed last month at the US District Court for the Central District of California.</p>

<p>Tesla is famous for missing deadlines, but the company's Shanghai factory, dubbed Gigafactory 3, seems to be on schedule. Tesla broke ground on the facility in January. Now media reports indicate that work is just about finished, and the company is weeks away from beginning large-scale manufacturing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-06/the-chinese-factory-that-could-make-or-break-elon-musk-s-vision">According to Bloomberg</a>, Tesla chairman Robyn Denholm said last week that Tesla is waiting for manufacturing certification from local government. The company hopes that will happen before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Tesla recently <a href="https://twitter.com/JayinShanghai/status/1192278528760459264">posted</a> images of some of the first Chinese-made Model 3s on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to Twitter. Tesla allowed Chinese reporters to take additional photos of the vehicle. There are a couple of obvious differences from the American model.</p>
<p>The back of the car has Chinese characters on the left and "Model 3" on the right. Like the cars Tesla is currently shipping to China, these new Model 3s also sport dual charging ports. One port is for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector">European Type 2</a> charging standard, while the other is for a Chinese charging standard.</p>
<p>Tesla will initially use batteries from Panasonic in its Chinese-made cars, just as it does in the United States. Bloomberg recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-05/tesla-is-said-to-reach-preliminary-battery-supply-deal-with-catl">reported</a> that Tesla is negotiating a deal to start using batteries from Chinese battery maker CATL starting next year.</p>
<p>Tesla is aiming to produce at least 1,000 vehicles per week at its Chinese factory before the end of the year. That could help Tesla achieve its overall goal to deliver at least 360,000 vehicles for the calendar year.</p>
<p>Tesla delivered 255,200 vehicles in the first nine months of 2019, so the company will need to deliver 104,800 vehicles in the fourth quarter. Tesla delivered 97,000 vehicles in the third quarter, so it will need to step up its game a bit in the current quarter. A few thousand Chinese vehicles could be enough to push the company over the top.</p>

<p>Recent in-the-wild attacks on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/05/microsoft-warns-wormable-windows-bug-could-lead-to-another-wannacry/">critical Bluekeep vulnerability in many versions of Windows</a> aren’t just affecting unpatched machines. It turns out the exploits—which repurpose the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/exploit-for-wormable-bluekeep-windows-bug-released-into-the-wild/">September release from the Metasploit framework</a>—are also causing many patched machines to crash.</p>
<p>Late last week, Windows users learned why: a <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2018/03/23/kva-shadow-mitigating-meltdown-on-windows/">separate patch Microsoft released 20 months ago</a> for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/meltdown-and-spectre-every-modern-processor-has-unfixable-security-flaws/">Meltdown vulnerability in Intel CPUs</a>. Word of the crashes first emerged five days ago, when researcher Kevin Beaumont discovered a malicious, in-the-wild Bluekeep exploit <a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1191642063315623937">caused one of his honeypots to crash four times overnight</a>. Metasploit developer Sean Dillon initially blamed the crashes on “mystical reptilian forces that control everything.” Then he read a <a href="https://twitter.com/sleepya_/status/1191239163959373824">Twitter post</a> from researcher Worawit Wang:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From call stack, seems target has kva shadow patch. Original eternalblue kernel shellcode cannot be used on kva shadow patch target. So the exploit failed while running kernel shellcode</p>
<p>— Worawit Wang (@sleepya_) <a href="https://twitter.com/sleepya_/status/1191239163959373824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a <a href="https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2019/11/fixing-remote-windows-kernel-payloads-meltdown.html">post published on Thursday</a>, Dillon wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Turns out my BlueKeep development labs didn't have the Meltdown patch, yet out in the wild it's probably the most common case.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Side effects of the Meltdown patch inadvertently breaks the syscall hooking kernel payloads used in exploits such as EternalBlue and BlueKeep. Here is a horribly hacky way to get around it... but: it pops system shells so you can run Mimikatz, and after all isn't that what it's all about?</p></blockquote>
<h2>Recursive loop</h2>
<p>Dillon’s post offers a deep-dive explanation for why his exploit didn’t work on machines that installed the Meltdown patch, which Microsoft called KVA Shadow, short for Kernel Virtual Address Shadow. In short, the mitigation worked by isolating virtual memory page tables of user-mode threads from kernel memory. The exception is a small subset of kernel code and structures, which must be exposed enough to swap kernel page tables when carrying out trap exceptions, syscalls, and similar functions. The shellcode spawned by Dillon’s Bluekeep exploit wasn’t part of the KVA Shadow code, so user mode couldn’t react with the Shadow Code. As a result, the kernel got stuck in a recursive loop until the system finally crashed.</p>
<p>Dillon has since <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/12553">rewritten the exploit code</a>. He expects the fix to be integrated into the official Metasploit Bluekeep module soon.</p>
<p>The crashes came to light after attackers started exploiting Bluekeep in an attempt to install cryptocurrency miners on unpatched machines. The exploits don’t spread from computer to computer with no user interaction, and as noted, they also caused many machines to crash, causing many people to discount the potential severity of the Bluekeep vulnerability. Microsoft researchers, however, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/11/07/the-new-cve-2019-0708-rdp-exploit-attacks-explained/">warned last week</a> that they “cannot discount enhancements that will likely result in more effective attacks.” They also said that “the BlueKeep exploit will likely be used to deliver payloads more impactful and damaging than coin miners.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marcus Hutchins, the security researcher who also goes by the handle MalwareTech, <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1192926816370970625">made a compelling case </a>that Bluekeep exploits have the potential to be severe even if they don’t spread as a worm from computer to computer without user interaction in the way the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/an-nsa-derived-ransomware-worm-is-shutting-down-computers-worldwide/">WannaCry</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/petya-outbreak-was-a-chaos-sowing-wiper-not-profit-seeking-ransomware/">NotPetya</a> outbreaks did.</p>
<h2>Internal pivot</h2>
<p>WannaCry and NotPetya exploited the server message block protocol, which was enabled in many desktop computers. Bluekeep, by contrast, exploits Windows’ Remote Desktop Services, which is usually turned on only on servers.</p>
<p>“A worm would not only attract a lot of attention, but be technically challenging due to the limitations of BlueKeep,” Hutchins <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1192926820506554368">wrote</a>. That hardly means Bluekeep doesn’t have the potential to do significant damage. Because servers typically act as domain administrators, network management tools, or share the same local administrator credentials with other network machines, they have the ability to control much of the network.</p>
<p>“By compromising a network server, it is almost always extremely easy to use automated tooling to pivot internally (Ex: have the server drop ransomware to every system on the network),” Hutchins <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1192926822473682944">explained</a>.</p>
<p>Bluekeep affects Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008. Patches for those versions are available <a href="https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0708">here</a>. Because of its severity, Microsoft has <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4500705/customer-guidance-for-cve-2019-0708">made patches available</a> for Windows XP, Vista, and Server 2003, which are no longer supported. People or organizations that have yet to patch should do so as soon as possible.</p>

<p>A lie has always been able to travel faster than the truth, and that <a href="https://apnews.com/8da97e49a9064b36baa047d98bb72272/Study-finds-false-stories-travel-way-faster-than-the-truth">goes double on Twitter</a>, where a combination of bad human choices and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/study-it-only-takes-a-few-seconds-for-bots-to-spread-misinformation/">bad-faith bots</a> amplifies false messaging almost instantly around the world. So what should a social media platform do about it?</p>
<p>The question is not rhetorical. Twitter is trying to come up with a policy for handling "synthetic and manipulated media," the company said <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/synthetic_manipulated_media_policy_feedback.html">in a blog post</a> today, and it wants your input. </p>
<p>That's Twitter's term for what most of us would call fakes, deep or otherwise. "We propose defining synthetic and manipulated media as any photo, audio, or video that has been significantly altered or fabricated in a way that intends to mislead people or changes its original meaning," Twitter Trust and Safety VP Del Harvey wrote.</p>
<h2>What’s the proposal?</h2>
<p>As many companies in many industries have done before it, Twitter is trying to thread a very careful needle. It doesn't want to remove content, so it's proposing something of a warning label—as on a pack of cigarettes, perhaps, similar to a recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebook-promises-to-beef-up-election-integrity-efforts-heading-into-2020/">Facebook proposal</a>.</p>
<p>In the face of manipulated content designed to manipulate people, Twitter says, it may:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>place a notice next to Tweets that share synthetic or manipulated media</li>
<li>warn people before they share or like Tweets with synthetic or manipulated media; or</li>
<li>add a link – for example, to a news article or Twitter Moment – so that people can read more about why various sources believe the media is synthetic or manipulated.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The company also says it will consider deletion of a tweet including faked media that "could threaten someone's physical safety or lead to other serious harm," but it does not define what might fall within the category of "serious harm."</p>
<p>You can provide feedback on the proposal <a href="https://survey.twitterfeedback.com/survey/selfserve/53b/191016?list=3&amp;co=BLOG#?">through this survey</a>, which does include the option to provide open-ended comments near the end. The company is also <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfulxKBUmYfgLqK5p2BgtH01tBaSRD870YwfLeABMZW7deww/viewform">soliciting partners</a> to help it develop detection tools for faked media.</p>
<h2>Not a day too soon</h2>
<p>True deepfakes might still be relatively rare, but doctored video and fake pictures Photoshopped together are all too common. The issue of what to do about them hit the spotlight in May when a video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that was heavily modified to make her appear drunk hit the Internet. YouTube pulled the clip, but Twitter and Facebook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/fake-nancy-pelosi-video-remains-on-facebook-and-twitter.html">both left it up</a>, drawing criticism.</p>
<p>Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebook-reddit-and-others-need-a-deepfakes-plan-now-senators-say/">contacted about a dozen social media platforms</a>, including Twitter, on October 1 to urge them to develop policies for handling fakes.</p>
<p>"Having a clear policy in place for authenticating media, and slowing the pace at which disinformation spreads, can help blunt some of these risks," the senators wrote.</p>
<p>For its part, Facebook recently promised <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebook-promises-to-beef-up-election-integrity-efforts-heading-into-2020/">a whole slew</a> of new "election integrity efforts" as the US gets within one year of the 2020 election. Among them was a plan to flag "false news" with a large, visible label when users click on it or share it to their own timelines, stories, or groups.</p>
<p>The biggest question, however, may be whether any such new rule or policy would apply to the highest-impact account holders, such as President Trump. Both Facebook and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/trump-tweets-will-get-warning-labels-if-they-break-rules-twitter-says/">Twitter</a> have explicitly exempted certain "newsworthy" accounts from their standards in the past.</p>

		<title>Microsoft Edge is coming to Linux. But will anybody use it?</title>

		<description><![CDATA[Edge wasn't even popular on Windows—adding Linux support is a curious move.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[





<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>At Microsoft Ignite last week, a slide announced that Microsoft's project to rebase its perennially unloved Edge browser on Google's open source project Chromium is well underway. Release candidates for the new Chromium-based Edge build are available on consumer and server versions of Windows (including Windows 7 and Server 2008, which have already left mainstream support), as well as MacOS, Android, and iOS.</p>
<p>Sharper-eyed attendees also noticed a promise for future Linux support.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/edge-linux-slide.jpeg"><img alt='Support for deprecated Windows OSes like Windows 7 and Server 2008 was already a surprise. But Linux? Sure, why not.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/edge-linux-slide-640x480.jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/edge-linux-slide.jpeg 2x" alt='Support for deprecated Windows OSes like Windows 7 and Server 2008 was already a surprise. But Linux? Sure, why not.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/edge-linux-slide.jpeg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Support for deprecated Windows OSes like Windows 7 and Server 2008 was already a surprise. But Linux? Sure, why not.</a> (credit: Zac Bowden)</p></div>
<p>Curious folks can <a href="https://microsoftedgeinsider.com/download/">download</a> canary or beta versions of the new Edge for most operating systems from <a href="https://microsoftedgeinsider.com/">Microsoft Edge Insider</a>—although there's nothing there yet for Linux. Browsing the Edge Insider site from Chrome on Linux replaces the download button with "Not supported for Linux." Using Firefox instead presents you with a download button for the Windows 10 version, presumably due to that browser's newly enhanced privacy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/firefox-is-stepping-up-its-blocking-game/">controls</a>.</p>
<p>We downloaded the Edge beta on a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM and took it for a quick spin. So far, it looks very much like Chrome itself—enough so that you might not notice which browser you're using unless you look very specifically.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/double-barrel-edge-and-chrome-980x613.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Chrome and the new Edge Beta are both running here on Server 2012. Yes, you can tell which one is which... but you really have to work at it.                      [credit:
                        Jim Salter                        ]
                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>For the moment, it doesn't look like there's much to get excited about in Edge's new Chromium flavor—it's pretty much just Chromium with one additional button that lets you go to your Favorites and another smiley-face button that sends feedback to developers. Browsing to <code>chrome://extensions</code> redirects you to <code>edge://extensions</code> and presents you with an offer to head to the Microsoft Store to find some. The profile button, similarly, takes you to a Microsoft login page rather than a Google one.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that the Linux world is going to go ga-ga for what seems to essentially be a reskinning of Chromium—but that might be missing Microsoft's real thrust here. Many developers—including Linux developers—choose Azure over rival cloud services like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, and bringing Edge to Linux may represent little more than a way to offer those developers deeper ties into Microsoft's profile and identity management services.</p>
<p>If a developer already has and uses Azure authentication for work, the ability to tie that authentication directly to the browser itself may be just enough to make Edge interesting.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>In an interview for the Axios HBO show, <a href="https://www.axios.com/uber-ceo-saudi-arabia-jamal-khashoggi-mistake-92865f2a-d97c-4d6a-b171-5e7c0a69e77a.html">released Monday morning</a>, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi seemed to downplay last year's death of <em>Washington Post</em> columnist Jamal Khashoggi. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">CIA concluded</a> that Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered Khashoggi's assassination.</p>
<p>"It's a serious mistake," Khosrowshahi said. "We've made mistakes too, right, with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake. I think that people make mistakes, it doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they've taken it seriously."</p>

<p>Within hours—and before Axios published the comments—Khosrowshahi walked them back.</p>
<p>"I said something in the moment that I do not believe," he said in a statement to Axios. "When it comes to Jamal Khashoggi, his murder was reprehensible and should not be forgotten or excused."</p>
<p>Axios's Dan Primack asked Khosrowshahi about the issue because Saudi Arabia's government is one of Uber's biggest shareholders. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, an official from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, sits on Uber's board.</p>
<p>When Axios asked if Al-Rumayyan should seek re-election to Uber's board, Khosrowshahi responded that he "has been a very constructive board member. I personally have valued his input greatly."</p>
<p>When Primack pointed out the CIA's findings—that far from being a mere "mistake," Salman had ordered Khashoggi's murder—Khosrowshahi said that he "didn't read that part of the CIA report."</p>
<p>"They're just like any other shareholder," Khosrowshahi said. "Now we're a public company. Anyone can invest in our company if they choose to do so."</p>
<p>An hour later, Khosrowshahi "called Axios to express regret for the language he used."</p>

          A Falcon 9 rocket launched into space on Monday morning.                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p><strong>11am ET Update</strong>: At the top of its launch window, the Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Florida and ascended into space. After dropping off its payload, the first stage returned to Earth and landed on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. It marked the first time that SpaceX had flown the same first stage four times. Overall, SpaceX has now had 50 consecutive successful launches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 60 Starlink satellites were bound toward low-Earth orbit, and later successfully deployed. Later today, they will begin the process of raising their orbits using on-board thrusters.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Successful deployment of 60 Starlink satellites confirmed! <a href="https://t.co/bpBqO9oYR3">pic.twitter.com/bpBqO9oYR3</a></p>
<p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1193921194707128320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Original post</strong>: SpaceX has readied a Falcon 9 rocket and a second set of 60 Starlink satellites for a launch on Monday morning. The company is targeting 9:56am ET (14:56 UTC Monday) for liftoff from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. Weather conditions appear to be favorable for the launch attempt.</p>
<p>After an "experimental" launch in May <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/05/spacex-returns-its-falcon-9-to-the-pad-for-another-starlink-launch-attempt/">of 60 satellites</a>, about 55 of which remain in orbit half a year later, SpaceX has made several modifications to this second batch of Starlink satellites.</p>
<p>"SpaceX has increased spectrum capacity for the end-user through upgrades in design that maximize the use of both Ka and Ku bands," the company stated in a news release. "Additionally, components of each satellite are 100% demisable and will quickly burn up in Earth’s atmosphere at the end of their life cycle—a measure that exceeds all current safety standards."</p>
<p>Starlink is intended to provide low-latency broadband Internet access around the world. By the middle of 2020, after six launches of satellites, the company plans to begin offering service to parts of North America through ground-based user terminals. Global coverage of the "populated world" will follow after the company completes 24 launches. The news release made no comment about efforts to minimize disruption to the night sky—about which astronomers have raised concerns—from a constellation that may one day include more than 10,000 satellites.</p>

<p>SpaceX is just one of several companies, including Amazon and OneWeb, racing to establish space-based Internet services from low-Earth orbit. With a second launch of maturing satellites, SpaceX appears to be leading the field. Although it represents an ambitious financial gamble for the company, the ability to fly 60 satellites at a time on reusable rockets would seem to give it an advantage over other competitors, which do not have such ready access to low-cost, rapid launch capabilities.</p>
<p>To that end, SpaceX <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/spacex-returns-to-the-launch-pad-for-a-second-starlink-mission/">will launch Monday's mission</a> on a Falcon 9 rocket first stage that has already flown three times. Moreover, the company will attempt to re-use a payload fairing for the first time. This means that about 80% of the rocket will consist of previously flown materials.</p>
<p>About 8 minutes after the launch, SpaceX will land the Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, about 45 minutes after liftoff, SpaceX’s two fairing recovery vessels, “Ms. Tree” and “Ms. Chief,” will attempt to recover the two fairing halves. One hour into the mission, the Starlink satellites are scheduled to be deployed at an initial altitude of 280km.</p>

<p>What's the likelihood that the next big "space western" film or TV series will succeed? The concept sounds great on paper: two genres colliding like a veritable peanut-butter-and-chocolate combo for nerds. And we'd like to be optimistic about the latest entry into this particular mashup, Disney+’s exclusive Star Wars series <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/disney-announces-new-star-wars-trilogy-live-action-tv-series/"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>, thanks to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/disney-leans-hard-into-space-western-territory-in-new-mandalorian-trailer/">some of the sexiest trailers Lucasfilm has ever produced</a>.</p>
<p>But entertainment has been trying to find the right balance between “western” and “space odyssey” for decades. Gene Roddenberry originally pitched <em>Star Trek</em> as a “wagon train to the stars.” The hottest guy in <em>Star Wars</em> was <a href="https://twitter.com/simonstalenhag/status/1193128007273197568">one cowboy hat away from going full John Wayne</a>. Yet most attempts tip face-first into the SyFy-style camp of <em>Cowboys vs Aliens</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Mandalorian</em> wasn’t made available for review ahead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/we-now-know-what-disney-will-look-like-plus-a-few-new-exclusive-series/">Disney+'s launch on Tuesday</a>, so it’s hard to know where it will land on the spectrum. Will it be an <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>-like success, or an <em>Attack of the Clones</em>-level bust? While we wait to find out, let us consider those who have succeeded in the space western pantheon, and those who have not.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0O29rZiIRA?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">A fan-made trailer for <em>Firefly: Season One</em>. </p></div>
<h2><em>Firefly</em>: "A leaf on the wind" as a country song</h2>
<p>The most critically successful space western, Firefly, of worked because it leaned heavily into romantic aspects. The setup borrowed heavily from the western genre’s post-Civil War origins, with Captain Malcolm Reynolds and first mate Zoe Washburne on the losing side of a great war. It took place on the edge of civilization, in frontier-like towns on distant planets. The soundtrack sounded straight out of a Ken Burns documentary. Mal wore the western-standard long leather duster and found himself in plenty of explicitly western tropes, like being thrown out the window of a space bar in "The Great Train Job."</p>
<p>But the show never tipped into cheese because the series carefully wove in many other tropes. This large-scale genre mixing, which was unlike anything on TV, meant that no one genre overwhelmed the story or became cliché. (The show's short run may have helped here, too.) The Chinese snatches of dialogue kept the western patois from becoming overwhelming. The alien Reavers and River's mysterious abilities pushed the sci-fi aspects forward. The series’ handlers never forgot that this was a space opera first and that the joy in watching was as much in the discovery of what’s out there as it was about the survival of the crew.</p>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtrUhIuEqdY?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Babylon 5, season one credits roll. </p></div>
<h2><em>Babylon 5</em>: Stealthy western style</h2>
<p>Sometimes the most successful space westerns are the ones where you never know you’re watching a western at all. Take <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/08/j-michael-straczynski-wants-to-reboot-babylon-5-as-a-big-budget-movie/"><em>Babylon 5</em></a>. It was doing multi-season-long arcs before prestige TV was a spark in HBO’s eye. It was championing <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Alliance_Resistance">the Resistance</a> before Star Wars even considered prequels, let alone <em>The Force Awakens</em>. But most importantly, it built a series following the same western-themed “order from chaos” story <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=187916"><em>Deadwood</em></a> would tell a decade later.</p>
<p><em>Babylon 5</em> works for the opposite reasons of <em>Firefly</em>. All of the western bones are in the story’s skeleton: the frontier, plus a crew of characters working to establish a peaceful point of galactic diplomacy and trade. There’s the show’s emphasis in the first season that the <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Alliance">Earth Alliance</a> should have been on the losing end of a great war, once again echoing the western genre’s Civil War origins. But none of those things are obvious. Instead, audiences get caught up in the depiction of dozens of different alien races thrown together, the Shadow War and the prophecies <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/John_Sheridan">surrounding Sheridan</a>, and, of course, all those time-traveling caretaker <a href="https://babylon5.fandom.com/wiki/Zathras">Zathras</a>.</p>

<h2><em>Defiance</em>: Too bad it didn't defy genre-melding expectations</h2>
<p><em>Defiance</em>, which launched on SyFy in 2013, tried to apply the <em>Deadwood</em> model to a near-future scenario, where the alien collective known as Votans have ravaged the Earth and cities must rebuild from scratch. But from the outset, <em>Defiance</em> made the mistake of making everything too literal. Instead of applying the “wild west frontier” to space, this series is set where the city of St Louis was, and its iconic Gateway Arch (you know, the "Gateway to the West," nudge, nudge) still stands. It sounds like a clever conceit: a space western, right on the edge of the Old West, but with aliens. But the resulting series, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/06/defiance-interview/">the tie-in video game</a>, wound up lacking imagination (like the brothel being called the “NeedWant Bar”) and leading to hokey scenarios (like Nolan constantly torn between a “good woman” and a “bad girl”).</p>
<p>Centering the show in and around St. Louis also meant it could never leave the planet for any sustained length of time without blowing up the entire premise, foolishly landlocking the show on Earth. Then there are clichés, like the Hatfield/McCoy rivalry between Datak Tarr and Rafe McCawley, which were predictable from the moment they were introduced. Instead of breathing new life into a recognizable fable, Defiance's family-on-family squabbles played out more like a bad reality-TV series of easily telegraphed plot beats.</p>
<p>Most importantly, other series like <em>Firefly</em> and <em>Babylon 5</em> neatly sidestepped issues of the western genre's unfavorable representation of American Indians. <em>Defiance</em> fails this test. Its evil-alien population, the <a href="https://www.tor.com/2013/06/19/defiance-for-better-or-worse-a-syfy-western/">Irathient</a> people, embodies every ugly trope of the “native enemy”—and came during a TV era when the creators should’ve known better.</p>

<h2><em>Star Trek V</em> &amp; <em>Solo</em>: Features that didn't feature western inspirations well</h2>
<p>As long-running series, <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> are successful examples of the space western. Sure, there are <em>Trek</em> episodes like <a href="https://www.agonybooth.com/battle-of-the-star-trek-western-episodes-66463">The One Where Worf Wore A Cowboy Hat</a>. And Star Wars has its share of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eN8zy_h4phE">desert planet scavengers</a>. But each tipped too far into camp in two particular feature-length examples.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> is famous for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-trek-v-killed-franchise-30-years-1216680">nearly killing the franchise</a>. From the opening of Sybok's evil "faith healer" to the infamous campfire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cqbSNERnc0">“Row, Row, Row Your Boat” singalong</a>, everything about this film is unintentionally funny. It might have worked in a 44-minute episode mixed in with other, far less openly western adventures. As a standalone, it was too much.</p>
<p><em>Solo</em> was Lucasfilm's last attempt at a space western story before this week’s release of <em>The Mandalorian</em>. There’s a lot wrong with <em>Solo</em>, from its lean on a “black characters die first” trope to the tone-deaf take that demanding equality should be treated as a punchline. But the insistence on taking Lucas’ vision of Han as a “space cowboy” and making it literal didn’t help. Solo already swashbuckled just fine without spelling it out (or giving his last name the dumbest reason for existing).</p>
<p>At least in terms of the genre’s history in recent pop culture, <em>The Mandalorian</em>’s space western stab is a potential risk for Disney+. Star Wars worked because it was a grand space opera that absorbed the western genre wholesale. Can it work stripped down to the essence of the space cowboy gunslinging his way through the galaxy? We only have one day to find out.</p>
