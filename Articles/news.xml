<p>Until recently, weaknesses in Android camera apps from Google and Samsung made it possible for rogue apps to record video and audio and take images and then upload them to an attacker-controlled server—without any permissions to do so. Camera apps from other manufacturers may still be susceptible.</p>
<p>The weakness, which was discovered by researchers from security firm Checkmarx, represented a potential privacy risk to high-value targets, such as those preyed upon by nation-sponsored spies. Google carefully designed its Android operating system to bar apps from accessing cameras and microphones without explicit permission from end users. An <a href="https://www.checkmarx.com/blog/how-attackers-could-hijack-your-android-camera">investigation published Tuesday</a> showed it was trivial to bypass those restrictions. The investigation found that an app needed no permissions at all to cause the camera to shoot pictures and record video and audio. To upload the images and video—or any other image and video stored on the phone—to an attacker-controlled server, an app needed only permission to access storage, which is among one of the most commonly given usage rights.</p>
<p>The weakness, which is tracked as CVE-2019-2234, also allowed would-be attackers to track the physical location of the device, assuming GPS data was embedded into images or videos. Google closed the eavesdropping hole in its Pixel line of devices with a camera update that became available in July. Checkmarx said Samsung has also fixed the vulnerability, although it wasn't clear when that happened. Checkmarx said Google has indicated that Android phones from other manufacturers may also be vulnerable. The specific makers and models haven't been disclosed.</p>
<p>"The ability for an application to retrieve input from the camera, microphone, and GPS location is considered highly invasive by Google themselves," Checkmarx Director of Security Research Erez Yalon wrote in Tuesday's analysis. "As a result, <a href="https://source.android.com/">AOSP</a> created a specific set of <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config">permissions</a> that an application must request from the user."</p>
<p>To demonstrate the risk, Checkmarx developed a proof-of-concept rogue app that exploited the weakness. It masqueraded as a simple weather app. Hidden inside were functions that could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take pictures and record videos, even when the phone was locked, the screen was off, or the app was closed</li>
<li>Pull GPS data embedded into any photo or video stored on the phone</li>
<li>Eavesdrop and record two-way phone conversations and simultaneously record video or take images</li>
<li>Silence the camera shutter to make the spying harder to detect</li>
<li>Transfer any photo or video stored on the phone to an attacker-controlled server</li>
<li>List and download any JPG image or MP4 video stored on the phone's SD card</li>
</ul>
<p>An attack wouldn't be completely surreptitious. The screen of an exploited device would display the camera as it recorded video or shot an image. That would tip off anyone who was looking at the handset at the time the attack was being carried out. Still, the attack would be able to capture video, sound, and images at times when a phone display was out of eyesight, such as when the device was placed screen down. The app was able to use the proximity sensor to determine when the device is face down.</p>
<p>Checkmarx's PoC app was also able to use a phone's proximity sensor to detect when it was held to a target's ear, as often happens during phone calls. The app was able to record both sides of the conversation. It could also record video or take images, a useful capability in the event the back of the phone was facing a whiteboard or something else of interest to an attacker. Checkmarx's report includes a video demonstrating the capabilities of the PoC app.</p>
<p>In a statement, Google officials wrote: "We appreciate Checkmarx bringing this to our attention and working with Google and Android partners to coordinate disclosure. The issue was addressed on impacted Google devices via a Play Store update to the Google Camera Application in July 2019. A patch has also been made available to all partners."</p>
<p>Samsung officials wrote: "Since being notified of this issue by Google, we have subsequently released patches to address all Samsung device models that may be affected. We value our partnership with the Android team that allowed us to identify and address this matter directly."</p>
<p>The statement didn't say when Samsung released the fix or how Samsung customers can check if the patch has been installed.</p>
<p>Checkmarx said Google has privately indicated that other makers of Android phones besides Samsung may also be vulnerable. Google's statement didn't directly confirm this or say if any other manufacturers have installed an update.</p>
<p>In an email, Checkmarx's Yalon said it wasn't clear why apps could access the camera without the user providing permission. He speculated that the weakness may be the result of Google making the camera work with the voice-activated Google Assistant and other manufacturers following suit.</p>
<p>Users of Pixel phones can confirm they aren't vulnerable by accessing Apps and Notifications from the settings menu, choosing Camera &gt; Advanced &gt; and App details. The screen should show that the app has been updated since July (and ideally much more recently than that).</p>
<p>Checking if other Android phones are susceptible will be difficult for most users. Those who are more technically skilled can run the following command:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$ adb shell am start-activity -n<br />
com.google.android.GoogleCamera/com.android.camera.CameraActivity --ez<br />
extra_turn_screen_on true -a android.media.action.VIDEO_CAMERA --ez<br />
android.intent.extra.USE_FRONT_CAMERA true</code></p></blockquote>
<p>The above command will force the phone to take video. The following command will force the phone to take a photo:</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$ adb shell am start-activity -n<br />
com.google.android.GoogleCamera/com.android.camera.CameraActivity --ez<br />
extra_turn_screen_on true -a android.media.action.STILL_IMAGE_CAMERA -<br />
-ez android.intent.extra.USE_FRONT_CAMERA true --ei<br />
android.intent.extra.TIMER_DURATION_SECONDS 3</code></p></blockquote>
<p>The skill and luck required to make the attack work reliably and without detection are high enough that this type of exploit isn't likely to be used against the vast majority of Android users. Still, the ease of sneaking malicious apps into the Google Play store suggests it wouldn't be hard for a determined and sophisticated attacker to pull off something like this. No wonder phones and other electronics are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/republicans-storm-ultra-secure-scif-some-with-cellphones-blazing/">barred from SCIFs</a> and other sensitive environments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[





<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Emu0I2hNfUk?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">Hugh Laurie stars as Captain Ryan Clark in <em>Avenue 5</em>, a new comedy series from HBO. </p></div>
<p>Passengers and crew aboard a luxury spaceship find themselves in grave danger in <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_5_(TV_series)">Avenue 5</a></em>, the new "space tourism" comedy series from HBO. Judging by the first teaser, the show looks like it could be a sharp, witty addition to the cable giant's slate of programming.</p>
<p>Clearly there's an appetite for space-based comedy in Hollywood these days, as Netflix teased its own comedy series, <em>Space Force</em>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/steve-carell-office-vets-are-making-space-force-a-netflix-comedy-series/">earlier this year</a>, with three major vets of TV's <em>The Office</em> on board, including Steve Carell as both a co-creator and a star. Netflix has yet to release many details about the series. All we know is that "The goal of the new branch is 'to defend satellites from attack' and 'perform other space-related tasks'... or something," per the <em>Space Force</em> teaser text. "This is the story of the men and women who have to figure it out."</p>
<p>We don't know much more about <em>Avenue 5</em>, but it also boasts some serious comedic chops. The series is the brainchild of Armando Iannucci, best known for creating the stellar HBO comedy series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veep"><em>Veep</em></a>, which won multiple Emmy awards over its seven-season run. And before he was Dr. Gregory House in the US, Laurie was best known across the pond for yukking it up as one-half of the comedy duo in <em>A Bit of Fry and Laurie</em> (with Stephen Fry), as well as his hilarious turns in <em>Jeeves and Wooster</em> and the various <em>Blackadder</em> series.</p>

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p><em>Avenue 5</em> is set roughly 40 years in the future, when private spaceflight, aka space tourism, is totally a thing. The titular space cruise chip is modeled after today's luxury ocean liners, complete with fine dining and regular exercise classes. But then the ship experiences major technical difficulties, putting everyone aboard at risk, while the crew scrambles to solve the problem while keeping the passengers from panicking.</p>
<p>In addition to Laurie, the cast includes <em>Silicon Valley</em>'s Zach Woods as Matt Spencer, head of customer relations—who does a very bad job reassuring passengers when the trouble starts. "This is a safe space," he says. "Emotionally. Physically we're obviously in terrible danger." Josh Gad (<em>Frozen 2</em>) plays smarmy billionaire Herman Judd, who owns the <em>Avenue 5</em> and pretends to be a man of the people, when he's frankly quite the snob.</p>
<p>Making Captain Ryan's job even more difficult is Karen Kelly (Rebecca Front), a bossy passenger who apparently is on board <a href="https://deadline.com/video/avenue-5-teaser-first-look-armando-iannuccis-hbo-space-comedy-series-hugh-laurie/">under false pretenses</a>, having used her sister's (nontransferable) ticket. Rounding out the cast are Suzy Nakamura as Iris Kimura, an associate owner of the ship; Lenora Crichlow as second engineer Billie McEvoy; Himesh Patel (<em>Yesterday</em>) as stand-up comedian Jordan Hatwal, performing on the <em>Avenue 5</em>; and Ethan Phillips as former astronaut Spike Williams, whose boozy womanizing ways are bound to cause tensions.</p>
<p><em>Avenue 5</em> is coming to HBO in January 2020.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>For a certain class of video game fan, no news could be bigger than today's: <em>Half-Life</em> is back. In VR. As an entirely new game from the series' creators at Valve.</p>
<p>We're here to connect the dots between what has been <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">announced</a>, what has been rumored, and what we've heard from well-placed sources. Rise and shine, <em>Half-Life</em> fans. We have a lot for you today.</p>
<h2>Months of rumors, then a TGA leak</h2>
<p>We should probably begin with the game's name, as revealed in <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">a leaked Game Awards 2019 presentation</a> and confirmed hours later by <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">an official post from Valve</a>. <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> is a brand-new game in the <em>Half-Life</em> universe designed exclusively for PC virtual reality systems (Valve Index, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Windows Mixed Reality).</p>
<p>This is, in fact, the oft-teased "VR game" mentioned by Valve over the past few years and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/valve-index-reveal-the-best-of-vrs-first-generation-but-is-it-worth-999/">the one we had been told to expect by the end of 2019</a>. Today's leak includes a revised release window of March 2020, which our sources indicate is likely—but also subject to change due to the phenomenon that fans call "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/celebrating-ten-years-of-half-life-2-episode-3-not-coming-out/">Valve Time</a>."</p>
<p>Today's announcement has confirmed a hard truth: Valve's game development teams still cannot count to three. In <em>HLA</em>'s case, it's because this is a prequel, not a sequel. And it's a full single-player campaign of brand-new VR content, though our sources can't confirm how long the game will actually take to beat.</p>
<p>The game's name confirms what has been loudly rumored for months: that you will play this game from the perspective of Alyx Vance, a character introduced in 2004's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2004/12/hl2/"><em>Half-Life 2</em></a>. Instead of stepping forward in time, <em>HLA</em> will rewind to the period between the first two mainline <em>Half-Life</em> games.</p>
<p>For those who have lost track of the series' timeline, the original 1998 game saw the Black Mesa research institute loose an alien race (the Combine) onto our planet. The sequel picked up an uncertain number of years later, with a network of researchers and resistance fighters working to take out the Combine's invasion and domination of Earth, in spite of a human-fronted organization that capitulated to the Combine's control.</p>
<p>Both of those games starred Gordon Freeman as a silent protagonist. This new VR game mixes things up by putting you in Alyx's shoes, years before the events of <em>HL2</em> and before Freeman's return to the series' universe. (This won't be the first time an official <em>HL</em> game wrested control from Freeman; the 2001 expansion pack <em>Half-Life: Blue Shift</em> starred the first game's beloved security guard Barney.) We've gotten an indication that the game's testing period hasn't shown any parts of Alyx's body in place of your own, beyond a pair of hands. But that could very well change.</p>
<h2>Grabbity Gloves?</h2>
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em> was arguably the gaming world's first major "physics adventure," since it revolved around a clever Gravity Gun system that let you pull and toss all manner of items big and small. We've gotten some indication that <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> follows suit.</p>
<p>A data leak from Valve's Source 2 game engine, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iB8LsrgOeBU">as uncovered in September by Valve News Network</a>, pointed to a new control system labeled as the "Grabbity Gloves" in its code base. Multiple sources have confirmed that this is indeed a major control system in <em>HLA</em>.</p>
<p>How do they work? We've gotten hints that they might more accurately be described as "Magnet Gloves," in that they let players magically point to and attract distant items to your hands. Instead of having to walk all the way to an object in VR or bend over to grab something from the floor, <em>HLA</em> players will have a handy point-and-snag system. And we're told that these are spiritual successors to <em>HL2</em>'s Gravity Gun, in terms of revolving around realistic physics. Maybe that means we can, or cannot, grab certain items due to real-life physics systems or obstacles.</p>
<p>However this system works, it seems to both favor the newer Valve Index controllers (which strap to users' knuckles and leave fingers free to move around) and offer concessions to older controllers like the HTC Vive wands. Valve has already announced plans to support all major VR PC systems for its next VR game, and these new gloves seem like the right system to scale to whatever controllers you bring into VR.</p>
<p>But we also get the sense that <em>HLA</em> is a serious showcase for Valve Index's "Knuckles" controllers. We hear that most every object in the game's world has been designed to be touched and manipulated by hands, both in terms of realistic physics and how real hands move through virtual objects. The best public information we have to this end is a recent DigiPen presentation from a Valve developer. Ever wondered how doors are constructed in VR? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kzu2Y33yKM">Valve developer Kerry Davis went on for over 30 minutes on the subject</a>, and our sources indicate that this scrutiny went into every single hand-manipulation system within <em>HLA</em>.</p>
<p>Our sources have told us not to expect one iconic weapon in <em>HLA</em>, however. Each of these sources mentioned that a virtual crowbar was tested at one point in the game's multi-year development but was eventually scrapped. To be clear: we don't have conclusive evidence that the crowbar won't eventually appear in the game in one way or another. (If Valve plans to upgrade the game with a physical crowbar purchase, my sources sure haven't heard of it.)</p>
<h2>Intentionally vague confidence...</h2>
<p>After getting over my initial shock that a new <em>Half-Life</em> game exists, I've come to be astounded by another likely outcome: that this new game will be a masterclass example of how to build an adventure game around the unique features of virtual reality hardware.</p>

<p>I have played quite a few VR quest and adventure games since home VR headsets began launching in 2016. Some have employed compelling mechanics but have run out of fresh ideas all too quickly. Others have slapped familiar combat and puzzles into a VR headset in ways that would have worked just as well on a flat TV screen. And still others have made VR users sit or stand around waiting for dialogue or long, boring walks to transpire.</p>
<p>What I know about <em>HLA</em>, at this point, has me convinced that Valve's VR game design teams share the same frustrations with been-there-VR'ed-that quests and that <em>HLA</em> won't repeat their mistakes. The little bit I know about hand manipulation in the game has me <em>tingling</em> with excitement.</p>
<p>Plus, as Valve's first game built from the ground up to tap into the company's long-in-development <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/valve-developing-three-full-length-vr-games/">Source 2</a> engine, I'm hopeful that we're in for a whole new caliber of facial animations and world details in a VR game—much like how <em>Half-Life 2</em>'s use of the first Source engine blew gamers away in 2004.</p>
<p>Whether we're in for a game that earns the <em>Half-Life</em> namesake, on the other hand, remains to be seen. Will it actually be long enough in terms of a satisfying single-player campaign? Will its plot's mysteries, as staged between two major games in the series, be sold in compelling sequences seen from a VR perspective? Will we get a VR robot dog as a pet?</p>
<p>I'd love to assure readers that we won't have long to wait to learn the answers to these questions and more, but, you know, Valve Time is a thing. We'll temper our excitement as much as we can with zero assurances of a true release date until the game is in both our literal and virtual hands, and we at Ars will keep you posted as soon as Valve lets us fake like Alyx for the sake of an <em>HLA</em> preview.</p>

<p>Imagine you're trying to make a left turn onto a busy road. Car after car rolls past, keeping you trapped as your frustration rises. Finally, a generous driver decelerates enough to create a gap. A check of the traffic from the opposite direction, a quick bit of acceleration, and you're successfully merged into traffic.</p>
<p>This same scene plays out across the world countless times a day. And it's a situation where inferring both the physics and the motives of your fellow drivers is difficult, as evidenced by the fact that the United States sees 1.4 million accidents each year from drivers in the process of turning. Now imagine throwing autonomous vehicles into the mix. These are typically limited to evaluating only the physics and to make conservative decisions in situations where information is ambiguous.</p>
<p>Now, a group of computer scientists has figured out how to improve autonomous vehicle (AV) performance in these circumstances. The scientists have essentially given their AVs a limited theory of mind, allowing the vehicles to better interpret what the behaviors of their nearby human drives are telling them.</p>
<h2>Mind the theory</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/great-apes-pass-a-false-belief-test-hinting-at-a-theory-of-mind/">Theory of mind</a> comes so easily to us that it's difficult to recognize how rare it is outside of our species. We're easily able to recognize that our fellow humans have minds like our own, and we use that recognition to infer things like the state of their knowledge and their likely motivations. These inferences are essential to most of our social activities, driving included. While a friendly wave can make for an unambiguous signal that your fellow driver is offering you space in their lane, we can often make inferences based simply on the behavior of their car.</p>

<p>And, critically, autonomous vehicles aren't especially good at this. In many cases, their own behavior doesn't send signals back to other drivers. A study of accidents involving AVs in California indicated that over half of them involved the AV being rear-ended because a human driver couldn't figure out what in the world it was doing. (Volvo, among others, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/09/volvo-gets-optimistic-about-the-future-with-the-360c-driverless-concept/">working to change that</a>.)</p>
<p>It's unrealistic to think that we'll give AVs a full-blown theory of mind any time soon. AIs are simply not that advanced, and it would be excessive for cars, which only have to deal with a limited range of human behaviors. But a group of researchers at MIT and Delft University of Technology has decided that putting an extremely limited theory of mind in place for certain driving decisions, including turns and merges, should be possible.</p>
<p>The idea behind the researchers' work, described in a new paper in PNAS, involves a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_value_orientations">social value orientation</a>, which is a way of measuring how selfish or community-oriented an individual's actions are. While there are undoubtedly detailed surveys that can provide a meticulous description of a person's social value orientation, autonomous vehicles generally won't have the time to be giving their fellow drivers surveys.</p>
<p>So the researchers distilled social value orientation into four categories: altruists, who try to maximize the enjoyment of their fellow drivers; prosocial drivers, who try to take actions that allow all other drivers to benefit (which may occasionally involve selfishly flooring it); individualists, who maximize their own driving experience; and competitive drivers, who only care about having a better driving experience than those around them.</p>
<h2>Value-oriented</h2>
<p>The researchers developed a formula that would let them calculate the expected driving trajectory for each of these categories given the starting position of other cars. The autonomous vehicle was programmed to compare the trajectories of actual drivers to the calculated version and use that to determine which of the four categories the drivers were likely to be in. Given that classification, the vehicle could then project what their future actions would be. As the researchers wrote, "we extend the ability of AVs' reasoning by incorporating estimates of the other drivers' personality and driving style from social cues."</p>
<p>This is substantially different from some game-theory work that's been done in the area. That work has assumed that every driver is always maximizing their own gain; if altruism emerges, it's only incidental to this maximization. This new work, in contrast, bakes altruistic behavior into its calculations and recognizes that drivers are complicated and may change their tendencies as situations evolve. In fact, previous studies had indicated that in contexts other than driving, about half of the people tested showed prosocial behavior, with another 40% being selfish.</p>
<p>With the system in place, the researchers obtained data on vehicle locations and trajectories as drivers merged onto a highway, a situation that often requires the generosity of fellow drivers. With the social value orientation system in place, the autonomous driver was able make more accurate predictions of its fellow drivers' trajectories than it could without—prediction errors dropped by 25%. The system also worked on lane changes on crowded freeways, as well as turns into traffic.</p>
<p>Using these evaluations, the researchers could also make some inferences using the traffic patterns they had. For example, they found that a highway driver may start out selfishly following the car in front of them, shift to altruistic as they decelerate to allow a driver to merge, then switch right back to a selfish approach. Similarly, drivers facing a merge onto a freeway typically ended up being competitive—something you see every time a vehicle pulls out and slows down everyone who was stuck in the lane behind it.</p>
<p>While we're still a long way off from giving autonomous vehicles a general AI or a full theory of mind, the research shows that you can get significant benefits from giving AVs a very limited one. And it's a nice demonstration that if we want any autonomous system to integrate with something that's currently a social activity, then paying attention to what social scientists have figured out about those activities can be incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=111819_PR%20MacBook%20Pro%2016%20Teardown&amp;utm_content=111819_PR%20MacBook%20Pro%2016%20Teardown+CID_d127ab6d541899ddcba51548a64c5d68&amp;utm_source=CampaignMonitor&amp;utm_term=MacBook%20Pro%2016">teardown</a> of the 16-inch MacBook Pro uncovered a laptop that is a sort of hybrid between the 2015 MacBook Pro and its butterfly keyboard-equipped successors. iFixit performs and publishes these teardowns both to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/hackers-farmers-and-doctors-unite-support-for-right-to-repair-laws-slowly-grows/">advocate for repairable devices</a> and to drive its own revenue by selling fix kits to readers.</p>
<p>The team found that the new scissor-switch keyboard has deep similarities to Apple's time-tested, standalone Magic Keyboard, as well as to the keyboards found in Mac laptops before the introduction of the butterfly mechanism. In fact, you can even swap in some of the old Magic Keyboard keycaps. The teardown writeup notes that there is no dust-proofing membrane on the keyboard switches, suggesting that Apple does not expect the same problems caused by particulate matter that users repeatedly ran into with the butterfly switches.</p>
<p>However, the keyboard assembly is still riveted in place, and repairing damaged switches is likely to be no more convenient or cost-effective than has been the case with the butterfly keyboards. Given the positive track record of the Magic Keyboard, you're much less likely to see failures in this keyboard—but if you do, you'll still be dependent on either your warranty or AppleCare to save you from big costs. Even most savvy users likely won't be able to perform the repairs themselves. For this reason and others, iFixit gave the new MacBook Pro a 1 out of 10 repairability rating.</p>
<p>The teardown also found notably larger batteries (totaling 99.8 Wh, barely under the FAA maximum) and a display hinge. Besides the keyboard, the other big story is an improved thermal system. iFixit discovered larger exhaust holes and bigger impeller blades, enabling up to 28% more airflow. This will likely help the MacBook Pro sustain performance on its highest-end CPU configurations under heavy loads better than its predecessors have.</p>
<p>Some of the ensuing conversation in comments and on Twitter has revealed one of the many weaknesses of Apple's "Pro" branding, with many users lamenting "almost no repair choices even though it's a 'Pro' device." Part of the problem with Apple's naming scheme is that "Pro" means radically different things to professionals in different fields. Some professionals might be entirely unconcerned with user-serviceability even as it's a chief concern for others.</p>
<p>Whatever kind of pro you are, though, it looks like the new MacBook Pro is designed to address two of the key criticisms of its immediate predecessor: unreliable keyboards, and inadequate heat management for sustained high-end performance.</p>
<p>We're testing the 16-inch MacBook Pro now, and we'll publish our final review later this week.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>A lawsuit filed against Comcast today accuses the cable company of using its market power to try to drive a regional sports network out of business.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.193357/gov.uscourts.cod.193357.1.0.pdf">lawsuit</a> was filed in US District Court in Colorado by Altitude Sports, a network that broadcasts games played by the Denver Nuggets, Colorado Avalanche, and other local professional and college teams. Altitude has been blacked out on Comcast since August 31, as the companies haven't agreed on what price Comcast should pay to carry the network.</p>
<p>Filing a lawsuit is at least partly a negotiating tactic in cases like this one, but Altitude claims that this is more than a simple price dispute. Comcast is offering less than Altitude's actual costs because it wants to drive Altitude out of business and then acquire the TV rights to the Denver sports teams itself, Altitude alleges.</p>
<p>"This complaint alleges textbook anticompetitive conduct," Altitude lawyer William Isaacson said in an <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/altitude-sports--entertainment-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-comcast-300960117.html">announcement</a> of the suit. "This lawsuit aims to stop Comcast from abusing its monopoly power to impose terms on Altitude to drive it out of business and prey on Denver-region families."</p>
<p>Comcast would be able to "quickly and easily take over regional sports production" in the Denver area if it forces Altitude out of business, the lawsuit said.</p>
<h2>Comcast dominates Denver TV market</h2>
<p>Comcast <a href="http://www.comcastsportsnet.com/">owns the regional sports networks</a> in major cities such as New York, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington, DC. But Altitude is owned by Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, which also owns the Nuggets and Avalanche, so Comcast has to purchase access to the channel in order to broadcast the top sports teams in Denver.</p>
<p>Comcast has a 57-percent share of the pay-TV market in the Denver area, compared to DirecTV's 25 percent, the lawsuit said. Comcast's dominance of the market "has increased since its first Altitude agreement over 15 years ago, as part of an unprecedented wave of [pay-TV] consolidation, expansion, and vertical integration," the lawsuit said. Altitude says this allows Comcast to exercise <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monopsony.asp">monopsony</a> power, in which a buyer becomes so large that it effectively controls the market.</p>
<p>In the recent negotiations, Altitude offered a five-year contract renewal with terms similar to the previous deal, but Comcast demanded "dramatic cuts in rates to be paid to Altitude," Altitude's lawsuit said. Comcast also proposed moving the Altitude channel from a cable package that reaches at least 70 percent of Comcast's local subscribers to one that only 15 percent of Comcast customers subscribe to, which would lower the amount Altitude can charge for TV advertisements, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Comcast knows these proposals "are economically unsustainable for Altitude or any RSN [regional sports network]," Altitude said. The rates offered by Comcast "were entirely unreasonable and unworkable for Altitude given the costs it pays to rights holders and its production costs," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Comcast also rejected Altitude's offer of a one-year extension under the previous rates and terms, which would have given "the parties more time to negotiate a long-term solution and avoid a situation in which Altitude was blacked out by Comcast," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Here's one of the key parts of the complaint, in which Altitude details its allegation that Comcast's long-term plan is to buy the broadcasting rights to Denver sports teams:</p>
<blockquote><p>By negotiating fees and carriage that undermine an independent RSN and require it to charge below its costs, Comcast knows that it can cause any independent RSN to go out of business. Comcast may then reacquire the content by either purchasing the RSN's television rights themselves or by ensuring that the RSN becomes part of some other consolidated ownership. Once Comcast reacquires the content, the subscribers return, mitigating any longterm losses. For these reasons, Comcast is incentivized to suffer a short-term temporary loss of subscribers to achieve enormous long-term gains.</p>
<p>Comcast is now using its monopsony power in the wholesale purchase of sports programming in the Denver DMA (designated market area) to drive Altitude out as a competitor in this exact manner.</p>
<p>After Comcast puts Altitude out of business, Comcast will attempt either to buy Altitude or set up its own RSN to replace Altitude. This means that Comcast is not only violating the antitrust laws' prohibition on acquiring or maintaining monopoly (monopsony) power as a buyer in the Programming Market (the market where Altitude sells its productions); Comcast is also illegally attempting to monopolize the Production Market (the market in which Altitude and other RSNs compete to create programming) by replacing Altitude with Comcast's own captive RSN. Comcast's attempt to monopolize the Production Market is a separate and independent violation of the antitrust laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Comcast has taken a far different approach with RSNs it owns itself, Altitude said. "Comcast has not made demands of or imposed drastic rate cuts or carriage reductions on its own affiliated RSNs throughout the country," Altitude said. For the Comcast-owned networks, Comcast continues to "sign new contracts for rates, equal to or higher than what it previously paid to Altitude," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Altitude's lawsuit asks the court for a declaratory judgment that Comcast violated antitrust laws and "tortiously interfered" with Altitude's business relationships with sports teams and advertisers. Altitude also asked for compensatory and punitive damages and an order that Comcast "distribute Altitude's programming on reasonable, non-discriminatory terms."</p>
<h2>Comcast charges regional sports fee</h2>
<p>Altitude was also blacked out on DirecTV, but the blackout ended in early November when the companies agreed on a price and distribution terms. Both Comcast and DirecTV charge a monthly "Regional Sports Network" fee to cover the cost of distributing networks like Altitude. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/directv-kept-charging-regional-sports-fee-while-channel-was-blacked-out/">investigating the companies'</a> decision to keep charging the fee during the blackout.</p>
<p>While DirecTV owner AT&amp;T <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/11/atts-stinginess-on-refunds-makes-even-comcast-customer-service-look-good/">made it difficult</a> for customers to get refunds on that fee during the blackout, Comcast automatically issued partial bill credits to account for the blacked-out channel. Comcast justified its decision to charge the remainder of the fee by noting that it also carries AT&amp;T SportsNet Rocky Mountain channel, which broadcasts Colorado Rockies baseball games, and the Pac-12 network that broadcasts college sports.</p>
<p>Altitude's lawsuit criticizes the Regional Sports Network fee, saying that it amounts to a "monopoly rent" charged to consumers. "The fees Comcast pays for regional sports programming in the Denver DMA dropped dramatically, but Comcast offered only a token bill reduction (as a public relations move after consumer outcry)," Altitude said.</p>
<p>We contacted Comcast about Altitude's lawsuit and will update this article if we get a response.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Back in 2012, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/01/supreme-court-holds-warrantless-gps-tracking-unconstitutional/">ruled</a> that it's illegal for the police to attach a GPS tracking device to someone's car without a warrant. But what if you find a GPS tracking device on your car? Can you remove it?</p>
<p>A little more than a year ago, the state of Indiana charged a suspected drug dealer with theft for removing a government-owned GPS tracking device from his SUV. This month, the state's Supreme Court began <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=sup&amp;search=&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=False&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">considering the case</a>, and some justices seemed skeptical of the government's argument.</p>
<p>"I'm really struggling with how is that theft," said Justice Steven David during <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=&amp;search=heuring&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=True&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">recent oral arguments</a>.</p>
<h2>One time in Warrick County</h2>
<p>The case began in July 2018, when the Warrick County Sheriff's Office got a warrant to attach a GPS tracking device to Derek Heuring's car. Information from a confidential informant had led them to believe that Heuring was using the vehicle to sell meth.</p>
<p>The GPS device transmitted data for a little more than a week. Then it stopped. Officers suspected Heuring had discovered and removed it.</p>

<p>After waiting another 10 days to see if it would start working again, detectives applied for a warrant to search Heuring's home and a nearby property belonging to Heuring's parents. US law requires law enforcement to show probable cause that a crime had been committed before engaging in a search. In this case, police said they suspected that Heuring had committed the crime of theft by taking the GPS device.</p>
<p>Police did find the tracking device. They also found methamphatamine and drug paraphernalia—evidence that police say show that Heuring had been dealing drugs.</p>
<p>So Heuring was charged both with drug dealing and with theft of the GPS device.</p>
<h2>Is it theft to remove a GPS tracking device?</h2>
<p>At trial, Heuring's legal team argued that the search had been illegal because the police didn't have probable cause to believe their client had committed theft. The defense pointed out that the device could have fallen off the car by accident or simply malfunctioned.</p>
<p>Even if Heuring did take the device off the vehicle, he couldn't have known for sure that it belonged to the government. It wasn't exactly labeled as the property of the Warrick County Sheriff's Office. Most important, it's not clear that taking an unwanted device off your car is theft—even if you know who it belongs to.</p>
<p>With the case now at the state Supreme Court, the stakes are high. If Heuring can show that the police lacked probable cause to search his house, he could get all of the evidence gathered in the search thrown out—not only evidence of GPS device theft, but evidence of drug dealing, too.</p>
<p>An appellate court ruled against Heuring in July, leading to the case <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=sup&amp;search=&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=False&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">reaching the Indiana Supreme Court</a> earlier this month. Initially, multiple justices seemed skeptical of the idea that taking a tracking device off your own car amounted to theft.</p>
<p>"If somebody wants to find me to do harm to me and it's not the police and they put a tracking device on my car and I find a tracking device and I dispose of it after stomping on it 25 times, I would hope they would not be able to go to a local prosecutor and somehow I'm getting charges filed against me for destroying someone else's property," Justice David said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the government acknowledged that it wouldn't be theft to remove a tracking device put there by a private party. But he argued that things are different when the government has a warrant to use a tracking device. The device had a legal basis for being on the car, the lawyer argued. By removing it and preventing tracking, Heuring was depriving the government of the use of its property.</p>
<p>The Memorandum Decision for <em>Heuring v. Indiana </em>from the Indiana appeals court is available as a <a href="https://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/07181901mgr.pdf">PDF</a> through the state government's website. The state Supreme Court is still currently considering the case after those <a href="https://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/20191108/justices-question-warrant-search-over-gps-tracker">oral arguments on November 7</a>.</p>

<p>For <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/trump-tries-to-shut-huawei-out-of-us-market-with-executive-order/">six months now</a>, the Trump Administration has banned US companies from doing business with Huawei. Nearly the entire time, there has also been a "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/google-and-huawei-can-support-devices-for-90-days-thanks-to-us-ban-exemption/">temporary general export license</a>" provision that allows current Huawei customers to continue to receive support for existing devices. The original order in May gave existing customers a 90-day license, and it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/report-us-expected-to-give-huawei-another-90-day-export-license/">was then extended</a> for another 90 days after that. That leads us to November 18, and today the US has given Huawei a third 90-day support window.</p>

Huawei is the world's largest telecommunications-equipment manufacturer and second largest smartphone manufacturer after Samsung (and before Apple). The company doesn't have a huge presence in the US, in part because the US House Intelligence Committee has for years <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/10/congress-accuses-chinese-tech-giants-of-un-american-activities/">flagged Huawei</a> as security threat thanks to its close ties to the Chinese government. The US government has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/trump-signs-bill-banning-feds-from-using-huawei-zte-technology/">banned federal agencies</a> from using Huawei equipment, and it has used political pressure to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/political-pressure-reportedly-kills-huaweiatt-smartphone-deal/">shut down consumer deals</a> with US carriers. Huawei has still managed to get some telecommunication equipment in the US, though, particularly thanks to rural carriers in states like Wyoming and Oregon. A coalition of these smaller carriers, the Rural Wireless Association, estimates that replacing Huawei and ZTE equipment could cost its members <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/5/18652769/huawei-china-security-rural-internet-rip-replace">up to a billion dollars</a>.</p>
<p>“There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities—we don’t want to knock them out," Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday. "So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate.”</p>
<p>As far as smartphones go, Huawei could possibly build hardware without further assistance from US companies, but doing it without US software is tough. The company has already had to ship the Mate 30 Pro in Europe <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/huaweis-new-flagship-smartphone-ships-without-google-apps/">without the Google apps</a>, meaning it's one of the few Android smartphones that doesn't come with Google Maps, Gmail, YouTube, and the Play Store (which provides access to 2.8 million Android apps). For now, Huawei is focusing on Android with its "Huawei Mobile Services" in lieu of Google apps. Huawei Mobile Services have been up and running in China for some time since Google Play is not available in China. The company is also working on its own operating system called "<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/huawei-announces-its-first-operating-system-harmonyos/">HarmonyOS</a>," but the company said that won't be ready for smartphones for at least three years.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to today's expiration or renewal deadline, Huawei has been out in force in the media. The overall messaging has been "the US needs Huawei more than Huawei needs the US."</p>
<p>For instance, Huawei's Chairman, Liang Hua, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/huawei-chairman-speaks-about-us-blacklist-impact-at-east-tech-west.html">told CNBC</a> today, “No matter whether there will be an extension, in terms of its real impact on Huawei, it will be very limited. Our products are able to be shipped without the reliance on the US components and chips.” In translated remarks, Liang said banning Huawei would “pose a bigger damage” to the US than it would to Huawei, and the move would "only damage the broadband network suppliers in those rural areas. It would only cause a bigger digital divide in the US.”</p>
<p>This latest 90-day extension means we should be dealing with this again on February 17, 2020.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Justice Department officials have long pushed for some sort of backdoor to permit warranted surveillance and searches of encrypted communications. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/ag-barr-is-pushing-facebook-to-backdoor-whatsapp-and-halt-encryption-plans/">Recently, that push has been taken international</a> with Attorney General William Barr and his counterparts from the United Kingdom and Australia making an open plea to Facebook to delay plans to use end-to-end encryption across all the company's messaging tools.</p>

<p>Now, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigations are <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-interpol-plans-condemn-encryption-203218710.html">attempting to get an even larger international consensus</a> on banning end-to-end encryption by way of a draft resolution authored by officials at the FBI for the International Criminal Police Organization's <a href="https://www.interpol.int/News-and-Events/News/2019/Safeguarding-children-from-harm-a-priority-for-global-experts">37th Meeting of the INTERPOL Specialists Group on Crimes against Children</a>. The event took place from November 12 to November 15 at the INTERPOL headquarters in Lyon, France.</p>
<p>A draft of the resolution viewed by Ars Technica stated that INTERPOL would "strongly urge providers of technology services to allow for lawful access to encrypted data enabled or facilitated by their systems" in the interest of fighting child sexual exploitation. Currently, it is not clear whether Interpol will issue a statement.</p>
<p>The draft resolution went on to lay responsibility for child exploitation upon the tech industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The current path towards default end-to-end encryption, with no provision for lawful access, does not allow for the protection of the world’s children from sexual exploitation. Technology providers must act and design their services in a way that protects user privacy, on the one hand, while providing user safety, on the other hand. Failure to allow for Lawful Access on their platforms and products, provides a safe haven to offenders utilizing these to sexually exploit children, and inhibits our global law enforcement efforts to protect children.</p></blockquote>
<p>Attendees of the conference told Ars that the resolution's statement was due to be published this week. But in an email to the New York Times' Nicole Perlroth, an INTERPOL spokesperson denied that the resolution was considered:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Interpol telling me this Reuter’s story is inaccurate:</p>
<p>Dear Ms Perlroth,</p>
<p>As per our statement there are, and were, no plans at this time for the INTERPOL General Secretariat to issue a statement in relation to encryption.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Press Office<a href="https://t.co/EItFe0D3Je">https://t.co/EItFe0D3Je</a></p>
<p>— Nicole Perlroth (@nicoleperlroth) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1196502885883756544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2019</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Ars requested comment from an FBI official and has not yet received a response.</p>
<h2>Easy button</h2>
<p>In a statement that flies in the face of the consensus of cryptographers and other technical experts, the draft resolution asserted that "technologists agree" that designing systems to "[allow] for lawful access to data, while maintaining customer privacy…can be implemented in a way that would enhance privacy while maintaining strong cyber security." In order to "honor and enforce" standards for prohibiting the distribution of "child sexual abuse material," the draft resolution states, "providers should fully comply with court orders authorizing law enforcement agencies access to data related to criminal investigations involving the sexual exploitation of children."</p>
<p>Facebook and other companies currently comply with warranted requests for data under the terms of the CLOUD Act—a law passed in 2018 that requires technology companies to provide data requested by warrant or subpoena to law enforcement, regardless of where in the world it is stored. But the officials behind this draft resolution claim such compliance cannot be achieved while allowing end-to-end encryption of communications.</p>
<p>As Barr and his compatriots noted in their October letter to Facebook, Facebook's ability to run analytics on and moderate content within users' communications <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/the-broken-record-why-barrs-call-against-end-to-end-encryption-is-nuts/#p3">amounted to 90 percent of the reports of child pornography to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2018</a>. By providing end-to-end encryption, officials contend, Facebook would essentially allow future child pornography distribution to "go dark" and prevent law enforcement from gathering evidence against suspects.</p>
<p>Today, there's little evidence that encryption has been a major impediment to interception of communications by law enforcement to date. According to <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/statistics-reports/wiretap-report-2018">statistics from the Administrative Office of the US Courts</a>, out of a total of 2,937 wiretaps in 2018, only 146 were encrypted—and of those, only 58 could not be decrypted.</p>
<p>Facebook has already deployed end-to-end encryption in products such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger (though Messenger does not provide end-to-end encryption by default). In response to Barr's letter, Facebook officials responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>End-to-end encryption already protects the messages of over a billion people every day. It is increasingly used across the communications industry and in many other important sectors of the economy. We strongly oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would undermine the privacy and security of people everywhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Ars <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/">has repeatedly reported</a>, many experts in the field of cryptography and security agree with Facebook's assessment. The security community has largely opposed most of the pushes for encryption backdoors on the grounds that any secret "golden key" to decrypt encrypted messages would be technically infeasible—and potentially exploitable by malicious third parties.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<div class="video"><div class="wrapper"<iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TFdzpVt5rbk?start=0&wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em">When SyFy unexpectedly canceled its award-winning science-fiction drama <em>The Expanse</em>, Amazon Prime snapped it up. </p></div>
<p>Fans of sci-fi series <em>The Expanse</em> have been patiently awaiting the much-anticipated fourth season. That wait is almost over. Amazon Prime just dropped the first full-length trailer for the new season, featuring the intrepid crew of the <em>Rocinante</em> venturing into exploring the many worlds beyond the Ring.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/weve-got-our-first-peek-at-s4-of-the-expanse-and-an-airdate-december-13/">we reported</a> back in July when the first teaser dropped, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)"><em>The Expanse</em></a> is based on a series of novels by James S.A. Corey (the pen name for writing team Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) that explore interplanetary tensions that are breaking out all over a solar system—mostly between Earthers, Martians, and "Belters"—long since colonized by humans. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/the-expanse-is-the-best-new-science-fiction-series-in-years/">Part mystery, part political thriller</a>, part classic space opera, <em>The Expanse</em> has earned almost <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/the-expanse-is-the-best-new-science-fiction-series-in-years/">nothing but praise</a> from critics and its devoted fans alike, not just for its gripping storytelling, but also for its excellent use of <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/science-expanse-tv-show-sticks-space-realities-one-big-exception/">accurate physics</a>. The third season earned a rare 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes (seasons one and two earned 76% and 96%, respectively).</p>
<p>So it was something of a shock when SyFy <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/05/the-expanse-canceled-syfy-after-three-seasons-to-be-shopped-1202388026/">cancelled the series</a>, citing "restrictive distribution arrangements," specifically, just first-run linear rights in the US. Fortunately, Amazon soon stepped in to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/the-expanse-has-officially-been-saved/">save the show</a>.</p>
<p>Season 4 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20697608/amazon-prime-video-the-expanse-james-s-a-corey-science-fiction-cibola-burn">supposedly based on</a> <em>Cibola Burn</em>, the fourth novel in the series, and it marks a new narrative direction as the crew of the <em>Rocinante</em> explores new worlds beyond the Ring Gate on a mission for the UN. Apparently, the access to thousands of Earth-like planets has "<a href="https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/trailers/1110645-new-expanse-season-4-trailer">created a land rush</a> and furthered tensions between the opposing nations of Earth, Mars and the Belt." The ship's first stop: Ilus, a colonial world where a dispute over the planet's rich natural resources has broken out between Royal Charter Energy (RCE)—the corporation that claimed rights to the world—and the first settlers there.</p>

          UN Deputy Undersecretary of Executive Administration  Chrisjen Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo) has a mission for the crew of the Rocinante.                      [credit:

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>This full-length trailer fleshes out a few more details. Via narration in the distinct raspy voice of Chrisjen Avasarala (<a title="Shohreh Aghdashloo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohreh_Aghdashloo">Shohreh Aghdashloo</a>), UN deputy undersecretary of executive administration, we learn that the UN initially sent a ship out to Ilus to control the situation. "The mission did not go as planned," Avasarala dryly observes, as we see images of a hole ripped in the ship's side and the ship crashing, scattering pieces across the planet's desert-like terrain. The <em>Rocinante</em> crew is charged with finding out exactly what is going on in this world beyond the Ring, with instructions to evacuate the Belters and themselves immediately if the situation warrants.</p>
<p>They are greeted upon arrival to "New Terra" by Adolphus Murty (Burn Gorman), chief of security for RCE, who is none too friendly toward the Belter refugees: "There is no version of this where we leave these squatters and murderers in possession of this planet," he says. The refugees are equally defiant: "This place is our only hope. We're not giving it up."</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the onset of mysterious swarms—similar to dust storms, only composed of what appear to be tiny robots. "That's protomolecule tech," <em>Rocinante</em> Captain Jim Holden (Steven Strait) observes. (<em>Expanse</em> fans may recall that an alien civilization created the protomolecule, which featured heavily in season three.) There's also evidence that various alien artifacts on the planet are "waking up," perhaps in response to something Holden has done. "I opened those gates, so I'm responsible for anything that comes through," he says. Now, the crew must figure out how to turn off whatever it is he has turned on.</p>
<p>Season 4 of <em>The Expanse</em> debuts on December 13, 2019 on Amazon Prime.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Last week, NASA's inspector general <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/nasa-report-finds-boeing-seat-prices-are-60-higher-than-spacex/">issued a report</a> critical of NASA's extra payments worth $287 million to Boeing for operational flights of its Starliner spacecraft. "In our judgment, the additional compensation was unnecessary," the agency's inspector general, Paul Martin, wrote in his report.</p>
<p>For the first time, the report also published an estimate of seat prices that NASA will pay Boeing for crewed Starliner missions to the International Space Station alongside prices the organization will pay for SpaceX's Dragon vehicle: $90 million for Starliner and $55 million for Dragon. Each capsule is expected to carry four astronauts to the space station during a nominal mission.</p>

<p>This report has evidently not sat well with Boeing, which on Monday fired off a lengthy statement in reply to the inspector general's report.</p>
<h2>“Strongly disagree”</h2>
<p>“We strongly disagree with the report’s conclusions about CST-100 Starliner pricing and readiness, and we owe it to the space community and the American public to share the facts the Inspector General missed,” Jim Chilton, vice president and general manager of Boeing Space and Launch, stated in a release <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-11-18-Boeing-Statement-Regarding-OIG-Report-on-NASAs-Commercial-Crew-Program">posted on Boeing's website</a>.</p>
<p>Boeing's response takes issue with several parts of NASA's report. But the company appears especially exercised about the claim that NASA overpaid Boeing for seats on the third through sixth Starliner missions, payment over and above what was originally agreed upon as part of the company's fixed price contract with the space agency.</p>

<p>"Through fair and open negotiations with NASA in a competitive environment, we offered single-mission pricing for post-certification missions 3-6, thus enabling additional flexibility and schedule resiliency to enhance future mission readiness," the Boeing statement reads.</p>
<p>In his IG report, Martin characterized these negotiations as "prolonged," and he said Boeing kept pressing NASA even after the agency initially declined to pay extra funds. And far from being "fair and open," Martin noted that in paying Boeing what the inspector found to be unnecessary costs, NASA denied the same opportunity to the other company in the commercial crew program. "SpaceX was not provided an opportunity to propose a solution even though the company previously offered shorter production lead times than Boeing," the NASA report states.</p>
<h2>“Actual experience”</h2>
<p>In its response, Boeing said its per-seat price was not $90 million, although the company declined to say what its actual price is or provide any documentation to support this claim. "For proprietary, competitive reasons Boeing does not disclose specific pricing information, but we are confident our average seat pricing to NASA is below the figure cited," the company's statement reads.</p>
<p>As part of its defense, Boeing also took a curious shot at its competitor, SpaceX. "Starliner flies on the most reliable lifter in the business, an Atlas V modified for human spaceflight safety by people with actual experience in the domain," the company stated.</p>

<p>It is not clear what "actual experience in the domain" refers to. A request from Ars for clarification was not immediately returned by Boeing.</p>
<p>However, it is not like United Launch Alliance or Boeing has legions of employees on its roster who have experience modifying a rocket for human launch. Such an activity was last done in the United States in the early 1960s, when the Martin Marietta Corporation modified the Titan II intercontinental ballistic missile for use in NASA's Gemini program.</p>

<p>It has only been 11 days since Apple released iOS 13.2.2, but once again we're seeing evidence of a greatly increased update cadence. Today sees the release of iOS and iPadOS 13.2.3.</p>
<p>This latest release is mostly a bug fix update—of course, that was apparent from the version number. Traditionally, Apple numbers its updates to signify their importance. Top-level updates like iOS 12 or iOS 13 are annualized major releases that start a new update cycle. One decimal point down (like iOS 13.2) denotes an update that adds major new features. One further point down (like this one, iOS 13.2.1) usually indicates that it is a bug fix update.</p>
<p>The update this week fixes problems users have encountered with search in the Mail, Files, and Notes apps. It also addresses a bug with attachments in Messages, an issue that stopped apps from downloading properly, and another with Exchange accounts under Mail that has frustrated many users.</p>
<p>Here are Apple's update notes for both iOS 13.2.3 and iPadOS 13.2.3:</p>
<blockquote><p>iOS 13.2.3 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work</li>
<li>Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view</li>
<li>Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background</li>
<li>Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The update should roll out to all devices supported by iOS or iPadOS 13 today. Users can check for it in their devices' Settings apps.</p>
<p>Apple is also working on a major feature release, iOS and iPadOS 13.3. That update is currently in beta with developers. Its biggest feature at present is the ability to set messaging and communication limits in Screen Time. It also allows users to disable the appearance of Animoji and Memoji stickers in the system's emoji keyboard.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>T-Mobile CEO John Legere will leave the company's top job after his contract runs out on April 30, 2020, <a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Mike-Sievert-to-Succeed-John-Legere-as-CEO-of-T-Mobile-on-May-1-2020/default.aspx">T-Mobile announced today</a>. Mike Sievert, T-Mobile's president and chief operating officer, will replace Legere as CEO on May 1.</p>
<p>Legere, who became CEO in September 2012, revived a struggling company and led the "Un-carrier" strategy that pitched T-Mobile as a customer-friendly alternative to the AT&amp;T/Verizon duopoly. T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/our-story/un-carrier-history">Un-carrier moves</a> changed some of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/t-mobile-is-sorry-for-charging-greedy-predatory-fees-will-mostly-stop/">punitive business practices</a> that mobile carriers routinely inflicted on customers.</p>
<p>But Legere's T-Mobile also helped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/t-mobiles-video-throttling-may-not-violate-net-neutrality-lawyers-say/">lead the way</a> in making <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/11/wireless-throttling-senators-ask-four-major-carriers-about-video-slowdowns/">throttling of streaming video</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/verizon-to-start-throttling-all-smartphone-videos-to-480p-or-720p/">standard industry practice.</a> T-Mobile was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/t-mobile-punished-by-fcc-for-hidden-limits-on-unlimited-data/">punished by the federal government</a> in 2016 for failing to adequately disclose speed and data restrictions on its "unlimited data" plans, and like other carriers, it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/t-mobile-sprint-and-att-still-selling-your-location-data-report-says/">sold its customers' real-time location data</a> to third parties. Legere often offered better deals than competitors, but US wireless prices still rank <a href="http://research.rewheel.fi/downloads/The_state_of_4G_pricing_DFMonitor_10th_release_2H2018_PUBLIC.pdf">among the most expensive in the world</a>.</p>
<p>Legere used a brash and combative style to promote T-Mobile, often insulting larger rivals AT&amp;T and Verizon by calling them "Dumb and Dumber." In 2017, he <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/the-dumber-championship">said</a> that T-Mobile's scientific research found that Verizon was the "Dumber" part of that pair. Legere will leave as T-Mobile attempts to complete its pending acquisition of Sprint, a deal that would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/dojs-plan-to-make-dish-the-fourth-major-carrier-has-a-fatal-flaw/">reduce wireless competition in the US</a> and make T-Mobile roughly the same size as AT&amp;T and Verizon.</p>
<p>Legere helped T-Mobile and Sprint win the Federal Communications Commission and Department of Justice's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/its-official-us-government-approves-t-mobilesprint-merger/">approval</a> of the merger, but the companies must still defeat a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/t-mobilesprint-merger-faces-big-test-as-nine-states-sue-to-block-it/">lawsuit</a> filed by a coalition of state attorneys general in order to complete the merger.</p>
<p>Legere was in talks with WeWork to take the CEO job at that company, The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere-11573494028">reported last week</a>. But Legere disputed that news today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970391/tmobile-john-legere-leaving-as-ceo-2020-mike-sievert">reportedly saying</a> that "I was never having discussions to run WeWork."</p>
<h2>Legere led “complete transformation”</h2>
<p>T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom gave Legere high praise today.</p>
<p>"John Legere has had an enormously successful run as CEO. As the architect of the Un-carrier strategy and the company's complete transformation, John has put T-Mobile US in an incredibly strong position," Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Höttges said in the leadership-change announcement.<div class="image shortcode-img right medium"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert.jpeg"><img alt='T-Mobile executive Mike Sievert.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert-300x404.jpeg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert.jpeg 2x" alt='T-Mobile executive Mike Sievert.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/t-mobile-mike-sievert.jpeg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">T-Mobile executive Mike Sievert.</a> (credit: T-Mobile)</p></div></p>
<p>The switch from Legere to Sievert is the culmination of a "multi-year succession planning process led by John Legere and the Board of Directors," T-Mobile said. Legere will remain as a member of the board after leaving the CEO position.</p>
<p>Sievert joined T-Mobile as its chief marketing officer in 2012, was promoted to chief operating officer in 2015, and added president to his list of titles in 2018. Legere was previously both president and CEO.</p>
<p>"I hired Mike in 2012 and I have great confidence in him," Legere said today. "Mike is well prepared to lead T-Mobile into the future. He has a deep understanding of where T-Mobile has been and where it needs to go to remain the most innovative company in the industry."</p>
<p>Sievert said that his "mission is to build on T-Mobile's industry-leading reputation for... deliver[ing] an outstanding customer experience" and to make T-Mobile "the leading mobile carrier" and "one of the most admired companies in America."</p>

<p>Streaming is the future of gaming. You can ask practically anyone, as long as that "anyone" is involved in selling games.</p>
<p>Ask Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan, who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/playstation-boss-we-believe-the-streaming-era-is-upon-us/">said in May</a> that "the streaming era is upon us" (convenient for him, since Sony has been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/06/sonys-playstation-now-pricing-is-insane-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be/">streaming games since 2014</a>). Ask Microsoft, which is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/project-xcloud-preview-serves-as-a-passable-portable-xbox-one/">testing streaming through its xCloud service</a> and plans to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/stadia-what-xbox-game-streaming-will-become-part-of-game-pass-in-2020/">add the feature to its regular game offerings next year</a>. Ask the CEOs of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/ubisoft-ceo-cloud-gaming-will-replace-consoles-after-the-next-generation/">Ubisoft</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/take-two-ceo-sees-streaming-gaming-hitting-big-in-one-to-three-years/">Activision</a>, both of whom seem to think traditional game downloads and discs will be a thing of the past in a few years' time.</p>
<p>(Just don't ask <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/03/is-your-pc-obsolete-onlive-brings-the-cloud-to-pc-gaming/">OnLive</a>, whose <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/onlive-shuts-down-streaming-games-service-sells-patents-to-sony-embargoed-7pm-eastern/">spectacular implosion in 2015</a> only proved that streaming wasn't the <em>past</em> of gaming.)</p>
<p>And you should definitely ask Google, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/google-jumps-into-gaming-with-google-stadia-streaming-service/">since March</a> has been telling anyone who will listen that streaming is the future of gaming and that Stadia is the future of game streaming. But with the Stadia service going <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/google-cant-fulfill-all-stadia-pre-orders-for-nov-19-launch/">live for some pre-order customers today</a>, a better question might be whether streaming is the <em>present</em> of gaming. More specifically, is Stadia a robust-enough product to convince players they can leave behind the comfort and safety of games running on local hardware in favor of games running on powerful remote servers?</p>
<p>After trying the service for a week through a pre-release reviewer program, the answer is decidedly "no." As it stands at launch, Stadia is too limited and too unreliable, with too little advantage to justify giving up on the established way of delivering and playing games. While there are some interesting fringe benefits to a gaming life in Google's cloud (and the potential for more in the future), today those benefits are not worth the headaches and risks associated with the transition to Google's platform.</p>
<h2>Hot wired</h2>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stadiares.jpg"><img alt='Stadia supports a range of resolutions and Internet speeds.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stadiares-640x360.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stadiares-1280x720.jpg 2x" alt='Stadia supports a range of resolutions and Internet speeds.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stadiares.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Stadia supports a range of resolutions and Internet speeds.</a> (credit: Google)</p></div>
<p>Google has been relatively up front about the bandwidth required to get a quality Stadia streaming experience in your home: 10Mbps minimum recommended for a "baseline" 720p experience; 20Mbps for 1080p; and 35Mbps for the full 4K experience. We tested Stadia on a Verizon FiOS connection (and the company-issued <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/fios-qgr-userguide140925.pdf">FiOS-G1100 802.11ac 5Ghz router</a>) in the Washington, DC, area. Speed tests on that connection reliably get 100Mbps upload and download speeds, so bandwidth minimums weren't really a concern (the connection gets <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest/55490383">a "Bufferbloat" rating of C from DSLReports</a>). We also intentionally throttled the connection via router settings to test lower bandwidth limits, and we found streaming quality more or less conforms to Google's recommended specs.</p>
<p>But getting a good gaming experience with Stadia depends on more than bandwidth. In a week's worth of testing, the Stadia stream quality seemed to vary wildly based on the mysterious vagaries of our home networking.</p>
<p>When running on a wired Ethernet connection, Stadia just about performed as advertised. That means smooth frame rates that generally held at 60fps and controls that felt largely indistinguishable from those on local hardware (even with the Stadia controller connected directly to the router via Wi-Fi). While there was likely <em>some</em> additional input lag over local play, in Ethernet tests it wasn't enough to be noticeable to the naked eye, even for twitchy shooters and fighting games. Playing with friends online was similarly smooth, with no significant lag over a wired connection (though we weren't able to test out online voice communications during the pre-release review period).</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">

        <p>
          For testing with a Pixel phone, Google sent us this custom-made Stadia controller grip that they're calling "the claw." It doesn't come in the pre-order package but will be sold on the GStore soon.                      [credit:
                        Kyle Orland                        ]

        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>The stability of wired Stadia play was in stark contrast to the Wi-Fi Stadia experience, which was inconsistent to the point of aggravation. This became apparent in our very first tests, playing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/mortal-kombat-11-review-great-gameplay-excessively-packaged/"><em>Mortal Kombat 11</em></a> on a Chromecast Ultra stationed on a TV one floor above the router.</p>
<p>The first few single-player matches played beautifully, with crisp, smooth graphics and controls that made quick special moves easy to pull off. Then the Chromecast suddenly warned me that my connection had become "unreliable" and that "gameplay may stop" if it didn't improve. The sudden message was all the more vexing because I was alone in the house, with no other devices actively running on the network.</p>
<p>At that point, I faced a noticeable drop in resolution and frequent frame-rate stutters that made the game nearly unplayable. As promised, gameplay was forced to stop a couple of times as Stadia kicked me back to the main menu (while I was able to reconnect relatively quickly and without losing my spot in the game, but it was still a major annoyance).</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi inconsistencies continued for the rest of the week. One day, the Wi-Fi connection would be so bad that I could barely get a Stadia stream to run for a minute on a Chromebook sitting mere feet from my router. The next day, that same Chromebook would provide an excellent Stadia stream in my downstairs kitchen even with a Netflix stream running on a nearby iPad. These were in locations in the house where I usually get a reliable Wi-Fi connection and where I didn't run into similar problems <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/project-xcloud-preview-serves-as-a-passable-portable-xbox-one/">when testing Microsoft's xCloud beta on a Pixel phone last month</a> (though xCloud resolution did bounce up and down a lot depending on the connection quality).</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/stadia1-980x597.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          The Stadia main menu interface, as seen in a Chrome browser (it looks largely similar on mobile and Chromecast)                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>Even the "bad" Wi-Fi experience was often "good enough" for slower-paced games like <em>Kine</em> or <em>Gylt</em>, where a bit of visual stuttering or a missed input isn't the end of the world. But on a game like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/destiny-2-forsaken-review-hallelujah-destinys-back/"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> or <em>Mortal Kombat 11</em>, these frequent and unexplained quality dips did not make me feel like this was the future of gaming.</p>
<p>Perhaps other testers with different routers or Wi-Fi spectrum environments won't see the same wireless issues with Stadia that we did. For now, though, if you plan to use Stadia over Wi-Fi, we highly recommend you borrow a "buddy pass" from a pre-order subscriber and test how the service works in your own home before making the investment.</p>
<h2>Pick your poison</h2>
<p>Stadia is in many ways three separate products bundled into one service. There's the Stadia available on a Chromecast Ultra hooked up to your TV. There's the Stadia available on Pixel phones (and other iOS and Android devices, eventually). And there's the Stadia available on any PC or laptop that can run a Chrome browser.</p>
<p>Ideally, all three of these would feel like seamless parts of one whole; a down payment on Google's promise of eventually bringing gaming to every screen in your life. At launch, though, all three feel like they were created by separate teams that barely talked to each other.</p>

<p>* Feature due for improvement/broadening in 2020.</p>
<p>Of the three versions of Stadia, the Chrome browser version feels the least robust. For one, it's currently limited to a 1080p image. That <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/op-ed-why-im-not-too-worked-up-about-the-next-gen-console-resolution-wars/">might not be too noticeable on an average living room TV</a> or on a tiny mobile phone screen. But it ends up being a real limitation when you're sitting only a foot away from a big PC monitor (or even a moderately sized laptop monitor).</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/destinycompare1-980x549.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          A gallery of <em>Destiny 2</em> screenshots, running at 1080p via Stadia in a Chrome browser...                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>More than that, the Chrome browser stream is noticeably less sharp than the same games running locally, even at the same resolution. The Stadia version looks like someone smeared a thin film of vaseline on the camera lens before sending the image to the monitor, as you can see in the above album of screens comparing Steam and Stadia versions of <em>Destiny 2</em> (the local version was captured at maximum settings and 1080p resolution). Google says higher-resolution streaming will be available via Chrome "as soon as early 2020," but for now, the browser provides a passable but disappointing Stadia experience.</p>
<p>That's a shame, because the Chromecast Ultra version of Stadia shows that the service has the potential to do more. The 4K images you get from a fully functional Stadia stream on your TV are hard to distinguish from those coming from a local PS4 Pro (assuming your Internet cooperates, as discussed above). Those images come with a bandwidth cost of up to 20GB/hour, though, so be wary if your Internet provider has a data cap.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Stadia-9-of-10-980x562.jpeg" alt=""></div>

          A shot of <em>Destiny 2</em> streamed at 4K to a Chromecast Ultra (image shot using a DSLR off a TV, because that is the only way to get fully portable Stadia screenshots from a Chromecast).                      [credit:

                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>Chromecast Ultra is also the only way to use the Stadia Controller wirelessly at launch (it needs to be hooked up via USB-C on mobile and PC, for now). That controller is one of the highlights of the Stadia launch package: it boasts a solid, well-balanced weight; comfortable, clicky face buttons and analog sticks; quality ergonomic design on the d-pad and shoulder triggers; and strong, distinct rumble motors. That's especially important, because the Stadia controller is the only one that works with Stadia on Chromecast (so be ready to invest in another for local multiplayer).</p>
<p>If your Wi-Fi cooperates, the mobile version of Stadia provides a convenient way to play high-end titles anywhere in the house. And Stadia's 1080p mobile stream resolution is plenty for the more limited smartphone screen real estate. But the mobile version is the only one that doesn't support voice chat and multiplayer parties at launch, for some reason. That's OK, though, because the mobile Stadia app is also the only way to <em>buy</em> Stadia games at launch, meaning you'll have to pull it out before buying games for the Chromecast or PC versions.</p>
<p>That oversight doesn't even cover <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/google-stadia-will-be-missing-many-features-for-mondays-launch/">all the features missing from all three versions of Stadia at launch</a>. Stadia games don't have an Achievement UI yet. You can't share purchased games with a subsidiary family account. The <a href="https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2019/03/19/google-stadia-assistant-help-feature-gaming/">ballyhooed Google Assistant integration</a>, which has its own button on the controller, isn't working at launch. And while you can capture screenshots and videos using a button on the controller, those captures are currently trapped on the Stadia mobile app, with no way to remove them or share them with the world until next year.</p>

<p>Many Stadia-exclusive features that were supposed to set the platform apart also aren't ready in time for launch, despite being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/google-jumps-into-gaming-with-google-stadia-streaming-service/">discussed publicly since March</a>. You can't <a href="https://stadia.dev/blog/the-magic-of-state-share-explained/">share unique game states through an easy Web link</a>. You can't stream your gameplay to YouTube and <a href="https://stadia.dev/blog/jump-into-multiplayer-games-on-youtube-with-crowd-play/">let viewers jump into your multiplayer session immediately</a>. And you can't <a href="https://stadia.dev/blog/stream-connect:new-possibilities-for-multiplayer-gameplay/">integrate your gaming viewpoint into another Stadia user's screen.</a></p>
<p>Maybe one day these features and more will put Stadia at or above par with other game platforms. Right now, across all three hardware use cases, the platform itself feels a bit half-baked.</p>

<h2>Was this trip really necessary?</h2>
<p>It should be clear by now that there are a number of technical and logistical headaches involved with the launch version of Stadia. But while Wi-Fi reliability will likely remain a problem for many, none of Stadia's launch issues are so severe they can't be fixed with time and effort.</p>
<p>Even if every single problem with Stadia was magically fixed tomorrow, though, the benefits of the service wouldn't necessarily be worth the costs.</p>
<p>One of Stadia's core value propositions seems to be the promise that you'll never have to buy "expensive" video game hardware again. Why spend hundreds of dollars on a new game console, the argument goes, when your existing Internet connection and hardware are all you need for quality gaming on Stadia?</p>
<p>That argument breaks down the more you look at it. Let's start with TV gaming, for simplicity's sake. For that use case, you'll need to spend $130 for a Chromecast Ultra and a Stadia controller. That's a bit cheaper than the going rate for a console these days, but it's not nothing.</p>

<p>More than that, using Stadia currently requires a $10/month Stadia Pro subscription. That might not sound too bad, but over a seven-year console generation it'll add up to $840 (not including the TV hardware costs). Meanwhile, if you bought a PS4 on launch day in 2013 and kept it until the PS5's expected launch late next year, you only spent $400 for the privilege (or $800 if you upgraded to the PS4 Pro a few years back). If you invest in 4K gaming on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/sony-confirms-the-playstation-5-is-coming-in-2020-reveals-new-hardware-details/">Sony's PS5</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/">Microsoft's Project Scarlett</a> next year, you'll probably pay a similar amortized cost over the years.</p>
<p>That's not a completely apples-to-apples comparison, since Stadia Pro also comes with some free games. But until we hear more about the promised "regular cadence" and selection of those freebies, it's hard to judge that program based solely on the launch availability of <em>Destiny 2</em>. And let's not forget that Sony and Microsoft both offer $60/year (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/03/dealmaster-grab-another-year-of-playstation-plus-for-45/">or less</a>) subscriptions that have provided two to four freebie games a month for years. Even considering hardware, that's still a lower seven-year cost than Stadia Pro. Alternatively, you can invest in console subscription services that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/09/dealmaster-you-can-still-convert-3-years-of-xbox-live-to-game-pass-ultimate-for-1/">provide instant downloadable access</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/sony-has-a-playstation-now-problem/"><em>hundreds</em> of legacy games</a>, if you choose.</p>
<p>(Stadia Pro's value looks a little better when compared to buying and maintaining <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/05/ars-technica-system-guide-spring-2018-the-show-your-work-edition/">a decent gaming PC</a>. But the Stadia version of <em>Destiny 2</em> is missing features like text chat, suggesting that the keyboard/mouse crowd isn't necessarily the main target audience here.)</p>
<p>Yes, Google will be launching a free "Stadia Base" streaming tier sometime next year that removes the monthly cost (and offering a Pro subscription option that doesn't require $130 in hardware purchases). But that free tier also limits streams to 1080p, the same visual quality you can already get locally from <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Microsoft-Xbox-One-S-1TB-Console-White/436204236">a $200 Xbox One S</a>. That's a bit more than the $130 Stadia TV package, but the Xbox One S offers much more gaming variety at the same time.</p>
<p>(If you don't care about TV gaming at all, or you don't care about the best streaming quality, that Stadia Base eventually starts to look like a better deal. That's even truer if you plan to go to the hassle of hooking your cheap laptop up to your TV for big-screen play.)</p>
<p>Ah, but Stadia is about more than just the TV. What about laptop and mobile play? A modern game console has you covered there, too. The PS4 has had the ability to stream games locally to PCs and Macs on the same home network <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/stream-ps4-games-to-your-pc-or-mac-with-next-system-update/">since 2016</a>, and it added <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/iphones-get-ps4-remote-play-almost-five-years-after-sony-xperia-android-phones/">iOS</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-stream-your-ps4-to-any-android-phone-1838909366">Android in-home streaming</a> this year. Xbox One users have been streaming their games to Windows machines <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-streaming-on-windows-10-has-a-hidden-very-high-quality-setting/">for years</a>, and the company has promised that "all games you own, or games you purchase in the future" will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/stadia-what-xbox-game-streaming-will-become-part-of-game-pass-in-2020/">streamable to phones via xCloud</a> starting next year (Microsoft has been vague on whether there will be an additional cost to this, though). And if you splurge for a gaming PC, Steam now lets you <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/valve-takes-in-home-streaming-out-of-the-home-with-steam-link-anywhere/">stream to devices <em>outside</em> the house</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/steams-next-big-feature-will-make-any-local-multiplayer-game-work-online/">stream a local multiplayer game</a> to share it with friends.</p>
<p>On top of all that, there's also the fact that Stadia's multi-screen "portability" only works at all if you have a reliable and decently fast Internet connection available. If you want true multi-screen portability, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">a Nintendo Switch</a> offers a serious (albeit lower-powered) gaming option that you can play in a car, train, plane, doctor's waiting room, etc.</p>
<h2>What's the point?</h2>
<p>When you get down to it, the actual benefits Stadia offers over other platforms start to look pretty weak. Yes, you can start Stadia games seconds after you buy them, rather than making time and hard drive space for a massive download. But if you have an Internet connection good enough for Stadia, downloading a game is just a one-time annoyance of a few hours per game (and both <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/get-help/help-library/games/installing--downloading---updating/how-to-set-up-auto-update-download-on-your-playstation-4/">the PS4</a> and <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/update-xbox-one-console">the Xbox One</a> can download updates automatically while you're away, if you leave them in standby mode).</p>
<p>Google could point to the fact that Stadia's data center hardware will always run games at the bleeding edge, with the necessary hardware upgrades to run games at their highest settings. It's a decent argument and one that will look better in five years or so when the next generation of console hardware starts to look long in the tooth. But it's an argument that's only true for the games that make it to Stadia in the first place. Thus far, the platform's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/only-12-games-will-be-available-on-google-stadia-in-time-for-nov-19-launch/">tepid launch lineup</a> of mostly months-old games doesn't give us high hopes that it will match Sony and Microsoft's vast libraries of first-party exclusives and first-run third-party content any time soon.</p>
<p>Google could point to the promise of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/get-ready-to-jump-in-the-stream-for-google-stadias-exclusive-games/">coming Stadia-exclusive games</a> that it says will use the distributed power of cloud architecture to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/google-wants-stadia-exclusives-that-are-not-possible-on-any-other-platform/">provide features that are "not possible" on a local machine</a>. But that promise remains unproven, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/02/crackdown-3-review-half-baked-action-with-tasty-triple-jumping/?comments=1&amp;post=36845895">rough experiments</a> like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/how-crackdown-3-uses-the-cloud-to-make-whole-cities-destructible/">Microsoft's cloud-distributed physics in <em>Crackdown 3</em>'s online mode</a> shows it's not so simple to convert promise to practice. The only Stadia exclusive at launch, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inxIiG8lNRI"><em>Gylt</em></a>, is an intimate and well-made puzzle-adventure thriller, but it's not the kind of platform-seller that will set Stadia apart at the moment.</p>
<p>In exchange for those marginal or unproven benefits, a Stadia customer faces some inherent risk by paying full price for games on a service that Google could shut down at any point. Unlike discs and (DRM-free) downloads, games you buy on Stadia could be completely inaccessible in the near future if Stadia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/04/googles-constant-product-shutdowns-are-damaging-its-brand/">goes the way of so many other abandoned Google products</a>. Despite Google's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/google-tries-to-reassure-gamers-its-behind-stadia-for-the-long-haul/">assurances that it's in it for the long haul with Stadia</a>, reasonable concerns still persist both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/stadia-launch-dev-the-biggest-concern-with-stadia-is-that-it-might-not-exist/">among game makers</a> and gamers themselves.</p>
<p>If Google wants to lean into Stadia's advantages and mitigate the risks, it would be better served positioning the service less as a full-on console competitor and more as a low-friction, screen-agnostic clearinghouse for sampling games. Spend a few minutes engaging with a streamed video ad, for instance, and you could earn an hour trying out any game in the Stadia catalog, immediately, on any device with a screen. Or, users could pay a bit more a month for an ad-free experience that offers instant access to all Stadia games for as long as Google is willing to continue accepting subscription fees.</p>
<p>That kind of seamless, YouTube-style instant access to a vast array of content could be worth all the headaches associated with Stadia, especially if the library of available games continues to grow. For now, though, investing in Stadia instead of a console seems like a bunch of hassle for very minimal benefit. Stadia could eventually grow into the future of gaming, but in the present, it's just not worth it.</p>
<h2>The Good</h2>
<ul>
<li>Over a wired Ethernet connection, streaming feels a lot like local play.</li>
<li>Stadia controller is solid and well-built.</li>
<li>4K streams on Chromecast look very sharp under ideal Internet conditions.</li>
<li>Starting games without the need for a download is pretty neat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Bad</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi performance can be extremely inconsistent</li>
<li>Chrome browser streams are limited to 1080p (for now) and look worse than similar resolution running locally.</li>
<li>A vast array of missing and "coming soon" features.</li>
<li>Up front/monthly costs don't provide much savings over a console (which can do in-home streaming).</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Ugly</h2>
<ul>
<li>The prospect of paying full price for games that only last as long as Google supports the service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Early adopters feel like they're getting a beta product here. Wait until next year to see if Google can work out the kinks and prove the service's longevity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[





<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Oculus Quest owners, your chance to dive into the world of PC-VR gaming has begun.</p>
<p>The Oculus Home app on Windows PCs has just been updated to support the standalone Oculus Quest, two months after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-quests-secret-trick-it-can-double-as-a-wired-pc-vr-headset/">the "Oculus Link" feature was teased and demonstrated at the most recent Oculus Connect conference</a>.</p>
<p>(If you're unfamiliar with the slightly confusing Oculus ecosystem of virtual reality, the above sentences are likely a bit confusing. If so, head <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/oculus-quest-review-2019s-best-new-gaming-system-is-wireless-affordable-vr/">here</a> for a refresher on what the Oculus Quest headset is, then <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/oculus-quests-secret-trick-it-can-double-as-a-wired-pc-vr-headset/">here</a> for an explanation of why this new Oculus Link update is a big deal.)</p>
<p>With Oculus Link enabled, the standalone Quest can now connect, via USB Type-C 3 cable, to a PC of your choosing and access the higher-powered VR library on PC storefronts like Oculus Home. We'll return after testing to confirm whether SteamVR also works properly via Oculus Link.</p>
<h2>AMD, for now, is DOA</h2>
<p>In the meantime, Oculus has confirmed a jump in required PC specs for Oculus Link use, which we knew might be coming due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/the-future-of-oculus-quest-hands-on-with-hand-tracking-pc-vr-link-mode/">Link's additional rendering pipeline demands</a>. AMD-graphics-card owners get some lousy news today: your systems will <em>not</em> work with Oculus Link at launch. Higher-end AMD cards will eventually be supported, Oculus reps tell Ars, while weaker Nvidia cards like the GTX 970 and GTX 1060 models will likely not be compatible with Link in the future.</p>
<p>That change in rendering pipeline also means PC-VR games, as rendered by a wired Quest, will look blurrier than on native PC headsets. Our tests at the last Oculus Connect event revealed tolerable VR performance on Quest via Link, but I called the results "a killer perk, not a PC headset replacement." Link's apparent downgrades to resolution and frame rate were significant enough at the time to reassure any owners of new kits like the Oculus Rift S to not regret their purchases.</p>

      </ul>
  

<p>We're still waiting for a release date for the official Oculus Link Headset Cable beyond "2019." When it launches, this $79 fiber-optic cable will offer a significant length for the sake of real-world movement—five meters, roughly the same as most wired VR kits—and a crucial right-angle connector to prevent awkward cord dangling. The Quest's USB Type-C port is placed high on one side, which isn't ideal for a jutting cord to be connected at all times; as a result, I strongly warned against plugging Quest hardware into a wall plug during standard play.</p>
<p>But you'll need to settle on standard cords at this point in the Quest Link beta period, and Oculus recommends a "high-quality" USB 3.0 cable. This brings up a huge catch: the USB Type-C cable that comes with every Oculus Quest system is actually rated for the USB 2.0 spec, so it won't work. If you're eager to dive into Oculus Link today, look out for a Type-C cable rated for either USB 3.1 or USB 3.2 speeds. (Oculus is currently recommending that members of the press try out <a href="https://amzn.to/2QvwXGk">this 10-foot cable from Anker</a>.)</p>
<p>Oculus made clear during September's conference that the Quest headset's few months of existence had driven significant software sales: $20 million of software in four months, versus $80 million of Oculus Rift software sales in over three years. Hence, it makes sense that Oculus is bullish on unlocking further software sales opportunities via today's new Link feature.</p>

<p>This holiday season includes two huge game launches for the Rift PC platform: <a href="https://www.oculus.com/stormland/?locale=en_US"><em>Stormland</em></a>, a guns-and-flight action-adventure, and <a href="https://www.oculus.com/asgards-wrath/?locale=en_US"><em>Asgard's Wrath</em></a>, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/skyrim/"><em>Skyrim</em></a>-like fantasy RPG. We'll have more on both of those large games by year's end, along with advice on whether either scales well to the inherent limits of Oculus Link's visual downgrades on Quest headsets.</p>

<p>Major publishers Capcom and EA are also absent from Stadia's current planned 2019 lineup, though both were listed as participating in Stadia's "launch window" as recently as August. Google has not yet responded to a request for comment on those omissions. [Update: A Google spokesperson told Ars that "'launch window' conveyed the first few months after launch.  What we announced today was the first 6 weeks."]</p>
<p>A handful of other unreleased titles that were promised for the Stadia launch window have simply been delayed into 2020. Those include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></li>
<li><em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/cyberpunk-2077s-hour-long-gun-filled-e3-gameplay-reveal-has-gone-live/">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em></li>

<li><em>Get Packed</em> (Stadia exclusive)</li>
<li><em>Orcs Must Die 3</em> (timed Stadia exclusive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the 26 titles planned for Stadia release this year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/get-ready-to-jump-in-the-stream-for-google-stadias-exclusive-games/">Tequila Works' horror game <em>Gylt</em></a> is the only one that won't be available on other platforms concurrently (though Google has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/google-wants-stadia-exclusives-that-are-not-possible-on-any-other-platform/">an internal development studio working on more exclusives</a> in the coming months and years). <em>Darksiders: Genesis</em> is due to launch simultaneously on PC and Stadia on December 5.</p>
<p>Looking at the 24 remaining 2019 Stadia games, 15 were first released on other platforms sometime in 2019, and five more were first released in 2018. The list of 2018 releases includes <em>Farming Simulator 19</em>, even though an updated "2020" version of the franchise is due for release on other platforms December 3. And while <em>Football Manager 2020</em> will also be launching on other platforms November 19, developer Sports Interactive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/developer-says-stadia-will-have-the-fastest-version-of-football-manager/">has said</a> the Stadia version will offer "the fastest way to experience <em>Football Manager" </em>thanks to Google's cloud data centers.</p>
<p>At launch, Stadia is only available <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/google-stadia-requires-130-upfront-10-per-month-at-november-launch/">via the purchase of a $130 bundle</a> that includes a Stadia controller and a Chromecast Ultra for TV play. A free tier, which does not require a separate hardware purchase or a $10/month "Stadia Pro" subscription, is planned for next year.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, China's space program has made news by revealing some of its long-term ambitions for spaceflight. These include establishing an Earth-Moon space economic zone by 2050, which, if successful, <a href="https://www.thespacereview.com/article/3828/1">could allow</a> the country to begin to dictate the rules of behavior for future space exploration.</p>
<p>Some have questioned whether China, which has flown six human spaceflights in the last 16 years, can really build a large low-Earth space station, send taikonauts to the Moon, return samples from Mars, and more in the coming decade or two. But what seems clear is that the country's authoritarian government has long-term plans and is taking steps toward becoming a global leader in space exploration.</p>
<p>By one important metric—orbital launches—China has already reached this goal.</p>
<p>In 2018, the country <a href="https://gbtimes.com/china-to-attempt-more-than-40-space-launches-in-2018-including-long-march-5-and-lunar-far-side-missions">set a goal</a> of 35 orbital launches and ended up with 39 launch attempts. That year, the United States (29 flights) and Russia (20) trailed China, according to <a href="http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/log2018.html">Space Launch Report</a>. It marked the first time China led the world in the number of successful orbital launches.</p>

<p>This year, China is set to pace the world again. Through Sunday, the country has launched 27 orbital missions, followed by Russia (19), and the United States (16). Although nearly a month and a half remain in this year, a maximum of six additional orbital launches are likely from the United States in 2019.</p>
<p>To be fair, China's space launch program has not been without hiccups. The country's space program is still trying to bring its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/11/china-now-has-a-rocket-that-can-land-taikonauts-on-the-moon/">large Long March 5 vehicle</a> back into service after a catastrophic failure during just its second mission, in July 2017. And the country had three failures in 2018 and 2019, compared to just one in the United States and Russia combined.</p>
<h2>US launches down</h2>
<p>The United States has taken a step back this year in part due to decreased activity by SpaceX. The company launched a record 21 missions last year but has so far launched 11 rockets in 2019. A flurry of missions remains possible in the next six weeks for the company, including a space station resupply mission in early December, a commercial satellite launch, and additional Starlink flights.</p>
<p>Another big factor has been a slow year for United Launch Alliance. The Colorado-based company has launched just two Delta IV-Medium rockets this year, one Delta IV-Heavy, and a single Atlas V mission. The company may launch Boeing's Starliner spacecraft before the end of 2019, giving the Atlas V rocket a second launch.</p>

<p>It is possible that Rocket Lab, which has flown its Electron rocket from New Zealand five times in 2019 and is planning at least one more mission before the end of the year, will have more launches than United Launch Alliance for the first time. Sometime next year, Rocket Lab should also begin to add to the US tally for orbital launches as it opens a new facility at Wallops Island, Virginia.</p>

<p>Saturday afternoon (Nov. 16) at Supercomputing 2019, Intel launched a new programming model called oneAPI. Intel describes the necessity of tightly coupling middleware and frameworks directly to specific hardware as one of the largest pain points of AI/Machine Learning development. The oneAPI model is intended to abstract that tight coupling away, allowing developers to focus on their actual project and re-use the same code when the underlying hardware changes.</p>
<p>This sort of "write once, run anywhere" mantra is reminiscent of Sun's early pitches for the Java language. However, Bill Savage, general manager of compute performance for Intel, told Ars that's not an accurate characterization. Although each approach addresses the same basic problem—tight coupling to machine hardware making developers' lives more difficult and getting in the way of code re-use—the approaches are very different.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/oneAPI-slide1.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          In this simplified block diagram of AI/ML development, Intel wants to isolate "Languages &amp; Libraries" as the biggest pain point.                      [credit:
                        Intel Corporation                        ]
                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>When a developer writes Java code, the source is compiled to bytecode, and a Java Virtual Machine tailored to the local hardware executes that bytecode. Although many optimizations have improved Java's performance in the 20+ years since it was introduced, it's still significantly slower than C++ code in most applications—typically, anywhere from half to one-tenth as fast. By contrast, oneAPI is intended to produce direct object code with no or negligible performance penalties.</p>
<p>When we questioned Savage about oneAPI's design and performance expectations, he distanced it firmly from Java, pointing out that there is no bytecode involved. Instead, oneAPI is a set of libraries that tie hardware-agnostic API calls directly to heavily optimized, low-level code that drives the actual hardware available in the local environment. So instead of "Java for Artificial Intelligence," the high-level takeaway is more along the lines of "OpenGL/DirectX for Artificial Intelligence."</p>
<p>For even higher-performance coding inside tight loops, oneAPI also introduces a new language variant called "Data Parallel C++" allowing even very low-level optimized code to target multiple architectures. Data Parallel C++ leverages and extends <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/">SYCL</a>, a "single source" abstraction layer for OpenCL programming.</p>
<p>In its current version, a oneAPI developer still needs to target the basic hardware type he or she is coding for—for example, CPUs, GPUs, or FPGAs. Beyond that basic targeting, oneAPI keeps the code optimized for any supported hardware variant. This would, for example, allow users of a oneAPI-developed project to run the same code on either Nvidia's Tesla v100 or Intel's own newly released <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-xe-ponte-vecchio-7nm-graphics-gpu">Ponte Vecchio</a> GPU.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/xe-architecture-slide.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Intel's 7nm Xe architecture is intended to cover the entire range of GPU applications, but Ponte Vecchio—the first Xe product—specifically targets high-end deep learning and training in datacenter and supercomputing environments.                      [credit:
                        Intel Corporation                        ]
                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>Ponte Vecchio is the first actual product in Intel's new Xe GPU line and is targeted specifically at HPC supercomputing and data center use. Although neither Savage nor other Intel execs Ars spoke to had timelines or would speak to concrete products, one slide from Intel's Supercomputing 2019 presentation clearly shows the Xe architecture as encompassing workstation, mobile, and gaming use—so there may be interesting times ahead for rivals in those spaces.</p>
<p>Savage told Ars that although the current version of oneAPI does still require developers to code for a particular architecture family—CPU, GPU, FPGA, etc—Intel plans for a future release to also allow automatic selection of the most optimal hardware type available.</p>
<p>The oneAPI toolkit is available for use and testing now at Intel <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/devcloud">Devcloud</a>.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Last year's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/xbox-adaptive-controller-retail-impressions-a-bold-start-for-limited-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC)</a> heralded a new era of gaming accessibility, but not necessarily in conclusive fashion. What Microsoft's specially engineered slab of a controller delivered in options and openness, particularly for gamers who can't use standard gamepads, the device lost in clarity.</p>
<p>The $99 XAC only comes with two useful buttons for standard PC and console games, and Microsoft said that was by design so that special-needs gamers could attach preferred buttons and control options into an array of 19 plugs. This was great news for anybody familiar with the wild world of accessible gaming or who already owned extra attachable buttons. But trouble arose, accessory-maker Logitech says to Ars Technica, when XAC's good press and popularity drew new, confused people into the fold—and into official Microsoft Stores, to boot.</p>
<p>"We talked to Microsoft retail—to people in the Microsoft Stores—and they kept telling us, 'We don't know what to recommend to people,'" Logitech Product Manager Mark Starrett tells Ars Technica. "People buy an XAC, then ask, 'What [buttons] should go with this?' The guy at the store can't assess the needs. The caregiver doesn't know [from a gaming standpoint], either."</p>
<h2>Turning “variable” into a constant</h2>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">

        <p>
          Comes with everything seen here. One of the mounting boards is rigid, while the other includes multiple folding points, like a standard tablet cover.                      [credit:

                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>That changes this week with the <a href="https://fave.co/2OmUhn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech Adaptive Gaming Kit</a>, which is a $99 bundle that begins answering that basic question for Logitech's estimated "80%" of special-needs gamers. Logitech offered Ars Technica a pre-brief about the bundle before shipping us a sample set, so we cannot speak to its build quality or whether it's a worthy purchase.</p>
<p>Still, based on my testing and research since the XAC launched, I'm already compelled to applaud Logitech's launch, at least in terms of apparent value and usability.</p>
<p>The crux of the Adaptive Gaming Kit is a suite of 12 discrete buttons that connect via XAC's 3.5mm ports. It's easier to parse them as a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three round buttons, 2.6-inch diameter</li>
<li>Three round buttons, 1.4-inch diameter</li>
<li>Four "light-touch" buttons</li>
<li>Two "variable" triggers</li>
</ul>
<p>Most articles about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/xbox-adaptive-controller-a-bold-answer-to-the-tricky-world-of-accessible-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XAC's launch</a> included photos of these kinds of buttons, with the idea being that users with various disabilities or needs would buy each one a la carte to add more functionality beyond the XAC and a nearby default Xbox One controller. But it doesn't take long to reach a $99 spending threshold at 3-4 buttons, which barely covers the entirety of a standard game's functions. On a sheer price level, Logitech has done the right thing. Target XAC users will likely need no fewer than four discrete buttons, so you're saving money compared to the rest of the fray by going with Logitech's set.</p>
<p>On top of that, Logitech includes two hook-and-loop boards and relevant connecting cables in this bundle. XAC users will likely want to mount extra buttons onto these kinds of boards so that they can remain more stable while near a controlling body part of choice: a foot, a fingerless hand, even a head. And they're a perfect freebie bonus for a set that's already reasonably priced.</p>
<p>To top all of that off, the included "variable" triggers play nicely with XAC's pair of analog 3.5mm ports. Most 3.5mm controller accessories only offer binary "on/off" switch functionality. That's fine for most controller functions but not for one that Logitech identified as a popular genre for special-needs gamers: racing.</p>
<p>"If you look around the [special needs] market... I haven't successfully found a good variable trigger replacement," Starrett says. "If you wanted to use gas and brake in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/forza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Forza</em></a>, stuff like that, there was no solution. Just binary digital buttons. So we include two of those in the kit. I'm a racer, and so are a lot of people we met. They want to play these games and struggle with this insane, 100% throttle thing."</p>
<h2>From 200 joysticks to 99 dollars</h2>
<p>Logitech says this project began on the side when Microsoft began asking for loaner joysticks a few years ago to test a secret project. (Starrett says they gave more than 200 joysticks to that aim before finding out what the XAC actually was.) Logitech's design team was looped into the shape, connection protocols, and launch plans for the XAC ahead of its launch, but the team didn't realize how many steps were left open for potential buyers, in terms of additional buttons, until after launch.</p>
<p>"I'm not gonna blind-read [the Xbox team]'s positions, but they don't make a lot of peripherals traditionally," Starrett says. "They make their controllers and consoles. They don't want to be in the peripheral business at this level, I don't think. Meanwhile, we're very expert in this area. We've done many things with Microsoft, we've supported their platforms for years. It was a natural thing [to team up on an adaptive controller bundle]. They might've gone and made one themselves if we hadn't said, 'We're going to do this and work with you.'"</p>
<p>Hence, Microsoft handed Logitech its Rolodex for special-needs gaming researchers and experts, including the UK non-profit Special Effect, a rehab center at Mt. Sinai Hospital, and XAC engineering lead Bryce Johnson. From that point on, Logitech spent the next year designing the controllers while "shaving down the profit margins" to get the bundle's price point to $99. The resulting bundle is now on sale at <a href="https://fave.co/2OmUhn9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logitechg.com</a> and at most American Microsoft Store locations; it'll come to European Microsoft Stores "if not day one, then shortly after."</p>

Each targets the all-important crossover buyer, and all in roughly the same $40,000 to $60,000 price range. After slurping up <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/market-evolution.html">most everyone's sporty sedan sales</a>, Tesla will start shipping the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/at-a-quick-los-angeles-event-tesla-announces-the-300-mile-range-model-y/">Model Y</a>. Volkswagen will reveal its ID.4 on Tuesday at the LA Auto Show, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/this-is-volkswagens-new-e30000-electric-car-the-id-3/">MEB-based BEV</a> is destined for US production in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Volvo's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/volvos-xc40-crossover-goes-fully-battery-electric-for-under-48000/">excellent XC40 crossover</a> is getting a big-old battery pack and shares its tech with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/volvo-spinoff-polestar-reveals-its-battery-ev-the-polestar-2/">the exciting Polestar 2</a>. And then there's the Ford Mustang Mach-E, which made its formal debut at a live-streamed event on Sunday evening.</p>
<h2>Compliance car to Mustang</h2>
<p>It was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/ford-opens-its-order-books-for-mustang-mach-e-electric-crossover/?comments=1&amp;start=0">a contentious move</a>, using the Mustang brand. It wasn't the plan, either—not at first. Originally Ford was working on what it openly described as "a compliance car," one built simply to meet incoming emissions rules in the US and Europe. But in 2017 it threw out those plans, putting together an internal skunk works called Team Edison with a brief to reimagine the project. Its goal was to design a BEV that could only be a Ford, and there's little that's more iconically Ford than the galloping pony.</p>
<p>In just over a year, and with heavy reliance on VR instead of clay models, Team Edison pulled at the shape to get away from a more generic take on the crossover. The main electric motor moved from the front of the car to the rear. The wheelbase grew by 8.5 inches (216mm), and the dash-to-axle ratio was lengthened. The A-pillar was pulled back toward the rear of the car, lengthening the hood line, and there's a clever visual trick with the roof rails that really works to place the Mach-E within the Mustang family when you see the car in profile or from the rear three-quarter angle.</p>
<p>It's a more challenging design seen head-on. The headlights shout 'Stang, as do the creases that run the length of the hood. But it can also look a bit tall and narrow, particularly when painted in darker colors. The best-looking variant is the Mach-E GT, set to show up in spring 2021. This has unique front styling, with optimized aerodynamics and a polycarbonate insert that ticks the box in your brain that expects to find a grille at the front of a car. None of the engineers would get specific beyond telling us that the Mach-E's drag coefficient was "below 0.3."</p>
<h2>Tesla's influence is clear</h2>
<p>The timing of Team Edison's tearing up of the compliance car does not seem accidental. (Nor does the choice of the Los Angeles Jet Center as the site of the reveal; it is <em>literally</em> next door to SpaceX in Hawthorne, California.) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/07/pared-down-electric-experience-driving-one-of-the-first-model-3s-off-the-line/">2017</a> was when the first Tesla Model 3s reached the public, and that car's influence on the Mach-E is clear the moment you open a door and step inside. A door you open by pushing a button; door handles are too <em>passé</em> here.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/the-tesla-model-3-reviewed-finally/">Like the Model 3</a>, it's basically a button-free zone. The center stack is dominated by a 15.5-inch touchscreen, portrait-style and proud on the dash. It runs Ford's latest QNX-based Sync 4, with an elegant and intuitive tile-based UI that shares design principles with both Tesla's and Volvo's latest infotainment systems. At the bottom of the screen is a physical jogwheel overlaid atop the screen, similar to the ones you find in Jaguar Land Rover's Touch Duo setups. Right now this is just set up to be a dedicated volume control, although it's easy to see how Ford could add more functionality to it as an input device through a later OTA update.</p>
<p>The Mach-E addresses a key complaint of ours when it comes to the Model 3 by providing a second dedicated instrument panel directly in front of the driver. Ford has been remarkably restrained with its use of this 10.2-inch digital display—it will show you your speed, range, and some other critical information, but not much else.</p>
<p>We weren't allowed to drive the Mach-E, but I did get a brief ride in one. The back seat is roomy—far more spacious than a Jaguar I-Pace—and bright and airy because of a full-length glass roof. Thoughtful design details abound; the arm rest between the driver and passenger folds up to provide the perfect place to stash your purse or man-bag, and the 4.8-cubic-foot (135L) frunk will have a drain hole, so if you want to fill it with ice at a tailgate, you can. (Open up the actual tailgate and the rear has 29 cubic feet/821L of cargo volume with the rear seats in use.)</p>
<h2>Five models to rule them all?</h2>
<p>Between late 2020 and spring 2021, Ford will bring out a mix of rear- and all-wheel drive Mach-Es with either standard- or extended-range battery packs. The cheapest of these is the Select; $43,895 buys you a rear-driving one of these with the smaller pack, but you'll have to wait until early 2021 to get one of those. That also applies to the $52,400 California Route 1, a RWD version with lower-drag 18-inch wheels and the long-range battery pack. All prices are before the IRS tax credit is taken into account; this will be $7,500 until Ford joins <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/tesla-sold-200000-cars-in-the-us-so-the-7500-tax-credit-is-going-away/">Tesla</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/gm-sold-200000-electric-vehicles-by-q4-2018-reuters-source-says/">General Motors</a> in having sold 200,000 plug-ins, at which point it will begin to sunset. Ford expects this to happen at some point in 2021.</p>
<p>If you want a Mach-E in 2020, it will have to be either a Premium—starting at $50,600 in standard-range, RWD spec—or the $59,900 First Edition, which combines AWD and the big battery. The big battery is also found in the Mach-E GT. This arrives last and trades range for performance—Ford is targeting a sub-4 second 0-60mph time for the $60,500 Mach-E GT, and there will be a Performance pack that drops this time into the mid 3-second range. Based on a brief ride in a development car—one that was "60-70% of the way to sign-off," according to the engineer—even the all-wheel drive Premium models should be accelerative enough to thrill most drivers trading internal combustion for electric propulsion.</p>
<p>Speaking of, the motors are an in-house Ford design, evolved from the company's experience with its hybrid line up. Both front and rear motors use permanent magnets, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-porsches-new-electric-car/">and like Porsche</a>, Ford has gone for a rectangular hairpin design for the coils that packs more copper and less air inside. The amount of power and torque depends on configuration; at the low end, a Mach-E Select should be about 190kW (255hp), and 419Nm (306lb-ft) for a RWD model. Ford's target for the AWD First Edition is 248kW (332hp) and 565Nm (417lb-ft), and 342kW (459hp) and 830Nm (612lb-ft) from the GT.</p>
<h2>300 miles should end range anxiety</h2>
<p>For the battery pack, Ford is using pouch cells from LG Chem, built into modules that are then combined in series and parallel. The smaller pack uses 288 cells in 10 modules to offer 75.7kWh, which should provide 210-230 miles (338-370km) of range depending on whether it's a single- or dual-motor Mach-E.</p>
<p>The larger pack is 98.9kWh, made from 12 modules of 376 cells. That's a lot of energy to play with, and Ford thinks that will be sufficient for 300 miles (482km) when fitted to a rear-wheel drive Mach E, which should go a long way to countering range anxiety. DC fast-charging one of those at 150kW should take the battery state of charge from 10 to 80% in 38 minutes.</p>
<p>Home charging is obviously a lot slower; about 22 miles per hour (35km/h) when connected to the standard 240V, 32A charger, or 32 miles each hour if you spring for the optional 48A wallbox. Like Audi and Porsche, Ford is partnering with Amazon to make the home installation process as painless as possible, and it's working with Electrify America and Greenlots to create a Ford Pass charging network of 12,500 public chargers, which should support plug-and-charge, where the car authenticates your account details with the charger as part of the handshake procedure.</p>
<p>Tesla's influence on Team Edison is also on display when it comes to buying a Mach-E. You can do that through a Ford dealer—2,100 in the US are certified to sell and service EVs, and each will have cars on hand to provide test drives. But Ford also wants you to be able to buy a Mach-E online, easily, without the normal song-and-dance routine that is the American car-buying experience. Exactly how that will work is still being determined since long-standing protectionist laws exist in most states that mandate that a dealer gets a cut when someone wants to buy a new car.</p>
