<p>Greetings, Arsians! The Dealmaster is back with another round of discounts and price drops. Today's list is headlined by a deal on the 128GB variant of Apple's 6th-gen iPad, which is <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-6th-Gen-128GB-Wi-Fi%2F955898738%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;subid1=dealmaster102919" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down to $299 at Walmart</a> as of this writing. That matches the price we saw during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/dealmaster-all-the-best-amazon-prime-day-2019-tech-deals-we-can-find/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon's Prime Day event</a>, and this price tag comes in about $30 below the typical price we've seen whenever the tablet has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/08/dealmaster-ipads-pixel-phones-routers-and-more-in-todays-top-tech-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been discounted</a> in the past year.</p>
<p>The big caveat here is that Apple recently replaced this iPad with <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-Latest-Model-Wi-Fi-32GB%2F216119597&amp;subid1=dealmaster103119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new model</a>, which starts at $329 for a 32GB model. That 7th-gen iPad bumps up the screen size from 9.7 inches to 10.2 inches and adds support for Apple's Smart Connector port, meaning it can use Apple's Smart Keyboard accessory instead of solely relying on Bluetooth keyboards. It also bumps up the RAM from 2GB to 3GB.</p>
<p>Other than that, though, this older model <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/mini-review-the-2019-ipad-has-a-new-skin-but-its-mostly-the-same-tablet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performs almost identically</a> to the new one. It <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/2018-ipad-review-content-creation-with-compromises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has the same A10 processor</a>, the same camera and battery specs, the same Lightning port and 3.5mm headphone jack, and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/ipados-review-the-ipad-is-dead-long-live-the-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">same iPadOS software</a>. It's also saddled with the same non-laminated display and relatively dated design. Springing more for <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F10-5-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold%2F803550045%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;subid1=dealmaster103119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an iPad Air</a> (or a <a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad%2Fipad-pro-10-5&amp;subid1=dealmaster103119" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refurbished 10.5-inch iPad Pro</a>) will bring you a noticeable hardware upgrade, the 10.2-inch iPad may grant you an extra year of iPadOS support down the road, and it's always possible Black Friday will bring prices down further. But if you just want an affordable iPad and value the extra storage, this is a good value.</p>
<p>If you're all set on the tablet front, though, we also have deals on Amazon's Echo Dot, the Apple Watch Series 3, USB-C PD wall chargers, and more. Have a look for yourself below.</p>

<p>Tonight, drivers in the US will kill more pedestrians than any other night of the year. An increase in people walking in low-light conditions makes Halloween the most <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/forget-poisoned-candy-and-razor-blades-heres-the-real-halloween-horror/">dangerous night of the year</a> for pedestrians.</p>
<p>Pedestrian deaths are on the rise overall, as cars become safer for drivers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20927512/traffic-death-crash-statistics-nhtsa-us-2018">but more dangerous for everyone else</a>. Sophisticated pedestrian detection systems, which are becoming more common in cars, aren't doing particularly well. Some of them score <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/six-cars-that-could-prevent-you-from-hitting-a-pedestrian/">highly on easier tests</a> in broad daylight, but they do <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/aaa-finds-your-new-car-probably-wont-stop-you-from-hitting-pedestrians/">not fare so well</a> in more difficult conditions like low light.</p>
<p>When a driver shares the blame for a pedestrian death with an automated car, how do people assign blame? A study in Nature Human Behaviour this week suggests that people may focus their ire on the human in a shared-control situation. The authors argue that this could result in an under-regulation of the safety of shared-control vehicles.</p>
<h2>Shared responsibility?</h2>
<p>Although the broad availability of fully autonomous cars lurks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/uber-tesla-and-waymo-all-struggled-with-self-driving-in-2018/">over the horizon</a>, a range of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)—from intervention during emergency maneuvers to Tesla's Autopilot suite—offload some of the responsibility for safety from the driver to the car.</p>
<p>"We are entering a delicate era of shared control between humans and machines," write researcher Edmond Awad and his colleagues. Understanding how people respond to the moral implications of this situation is crucial for everything from calculating the expected liability for manufacturers, to anticipating how the legal system should react to deaths in situations of shared control between driver and car.</p>
<p>How the people who set these policies will react is anyone's guess. Based on press coverage of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/ntsb-teslas-autopilot-ux-a-major-role-in-fatal-model-s-crash/">2016 Tesla Autopilot death</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/arizona-prosecutor-wont-charge-uber-for-2018-self-driving-death/">killing of a pedestrian by an Uber self-driving car</a>, it seems that people might be more inclined to heap blame heavily on the human drivers and less on the cars, Awad and his colleagues suggest. "Was this pattern a fluke of the circumstances of the crash and press environment?" they ask. "Or does it reflect something psychologically deeper that may colour our responses to human-machine joint action and, in particular, when a human-machine pair jointly controls a vehicle?"</p>
<h2>Bad call vs negligence</h2>
<p>To test this, Awad and colleagues constructed a series of vignettes that described a shared-control car killing a pedestrian. These vignettes described a range of sole- or dual-driver car options, ranging from a sole human driver to a fully automated car (referred to in the vignettes as a "machine driver").</p>
<p>In between were dual-driver options with a primary human driver and a secondary machine driver (much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/toyota-is-betting-fully-driverless-cars-are-still-years-away/">Toyota's Guardian</a>) or a primary machine driver and secondary human driver (like Tesla's Autopilot). There were also options for human-human pairings—like dual-control cars for people learning to drive—and machine-machine pairings.</p>
<p>The researchers explored how people apportioned blame in these setups. First, each person read a description of one of the different driver combinations—so each participant only ever had to think about one type of human-machine jointly driven car. Then, they read about two different crash scenarios, both of which described driver error leading to the death of a pedestrian. But the two scenarios differed in whether both drivers made an error or only one of them.</p>
<p>In "bad intervention" scenarios, the main driver (either human or machine) makes a driving decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrian, but the secondary driver intervenes with the wrong call, resulting in a collision. In bad interventions, it makes sense that the secondary driver is really the one to blame, since they overrode the correct actions of the primary driver.</p>
<p>This expectation matches how people reacted. When participants saw this scenario and rated how blameworthy each driver was and how much they caused the death, on a scale of 1 to 100, the secondary driver came out bearing most of the blame. This was true whether or not the secondary driver was a human or machine.</p>
<p>In "missed intervention" scenarios, though, things looked a little different. In these scenarios, the main driver is the one who makes the wrong call, but the secondary driver doesn't intervene to rescue the situation. In these scenarios, both drivers made an error.</p>
<p>Participants did apportion some blame to both drivers in these scenarios—but the human took more blame than the car. This was true when the human had made the initial error and the car had failed to correct it—and it was also true when the car made the error and the human failed to correct. That suggests that participants weren't assigning blame based on whether the driver had made a wrong call or just not intervened; rather, they were assigning blame based on the type of driver.</p>
<p>These results replicated across different studies, including a replication that used a different participant sample and two that tweaked the presentation of the vignettes to make them look more like newspaper articles.</p>
<h2>Under-reacting to the dangers</h2>
<p>The results might be intuitive, but science is about checking whether intuitions are supported by actual data. People seem to understand that self-driving cars have pretty hard limitations on dealing flexibly with a range of scenarios and that the more flexible driver—the human—should be trying to compensate for that.</p>
<p>The study isn't the final word. For one thing, participants knew they weren't reading real stories, which could have affected their answers—but the responses do match the public reactions to the Tesla and Uber crashes, the authors note. "While there may be many psychological barriers to self-driving car adoption," they write, "public over-reaction to dual-error cases is not likely to be one of them."</p>
<p>Instead, the researchers argue, there might be a risk of <em>under-reaction</em>. If regulation of self-driving cars is based on public pressure and juries' decisions, car manufacturers might be absolved of blame pretty easily. And that might reduce the pressure for manufacturers to improve their systems.</p>
<p>There's a historical analogue for this, write Awad and his co-authors: people used to ignore car manufacturers' liability when car occupants were hurt in collisions, because they attributed the collisions to driver error. "Top-down regulation was necessary to introduce the concept of 'crash worthiness' into the legal system," they note. Similarly, they argue, self-driving car safety might need top-down safety regulations.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>In 2014, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/06/supreme-court-smashes-do-it-on-a-computer-patents-in-9-0-opinion/">Supreme Court ruled</a> that you can't get a patent for implementing an otherwise abstract idea on a computer. The decision, known as <em>CLS Bank v. Alice</em>, has had a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/06/why-the-supreme-courts-software-patent-ban-didnt-last/">big impact</a> over the last five years, invalidating a lot of broad software patents.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txed.182805/gov.uscourts.txed.182805.283.0.pdf">ruling this week</a> illustrates the limits of that landmark ruling. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAA">confusingly named</a> United Services Automobile Association, which provides insurance and other financial products, sued Wells Fargo for infringing two patents on the concept of cashing checks with a mobile device. Wells Fargo argued that the patents were abstract—and therefore invalid—under the <em>Alice</em> rule.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txed.182805/gov.uscourts.txed.182805.283.0.pdf">Texas federal judge disagreed</a>, upholding the patents and allowing the case to move forward to trial.</p>
<h2>Computers are more precise than humans</h2>
<p>The patents cover check-cashing mobile apps that automatically snap a photo once a suitable image of the check is in the field of view.</p>
<p>A key claim of <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8977571B1/en">one of the USAA patents</a> covers the concept of using a "processor" (aka a smartphone) to take a picture of a check and then send the check over a "communication pathway" (aka a network). USAA's supposed invention is the idea of monitoring "an image of the check in a field of view of a camera of a mobile device with respect to a monitoring criterion using an image monitoring and capture module of the mobile device"—and waiting until the image has met the criteria (is the entire check in the frame? Is there adequate light?) before snapping the picture. In other words, they patented the idea that you should wait until you have a good shot before snapping a picture.</p>

<p>The patent isn't limited to any particular "monitoring criteria." Any app that automatically takes an image when a check is in the field of view would likely infringe USAA's patent.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo argued that USAA had simply used a computer to perform the same steps any human being would take when snapping a photo of a check. Obviously if a human being was snapping a picture of a check, they would monitor the image in the viewfinder and only click the button once it showed an acceptable image.</p>
<p>But the court disagreed, noting that human eyes and human brains can't measure objective criteria like brightness as precisely as a computer can. USAA has argued that its approach leads to fewer bad check images being submitted. So in the court's view, the patent doesn't just cover an old-fashioned process being done on a computer—the use of the computer improves the process, yielding a patentable invention.</p>
<h2>The case is far from over</h2>
<p>The court's conclusion here is a bit of a head-scratcher. Obviously computers can perform many tasks faster and more precisely than a human being—that's why people use them. But if this fact were all it took to make "do it on a computer" inventions patentable, the <em>Alice</em> precedent would be a dead letter.</p>
<p>After all, the patent in the original <em>Alice</em> case claimed the concept of using a computer to perform certain types of financial transactions. The court invalidated the patents because they were simply computerizing existing financial techniques. But it's surely true that computers can perform these financial transactions faster and with fewer errors than human traders can. That fact didn't save those patents, and it's not clear why it should help USAA here.</p>

<p>One factor that may have influenced the judge's thinking is the fact that framing a shot of a check is not an explicitly mathematical operation the way the financial transactions in Alice were. Under the hood, of course, everything a computer does is mathematical. But a human framing a photograph doesn't take explicitly numerical measurements. Perhaps this makes the gap between the human and automated processes seem larger for picture-taking than for financial transactions.</p>
<p>The ruling in the USAA case came from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/why-patent-trolls-go-to-east-texas-explained/">notoriously patent-friendly</a> Eastern District of Texas, so it's not that surprising that the ruling favored the patent holder. But the case is far from over. The case will now move forward toward trial, where Wells Fargo can raise other objections—perhaps including an argument that the USAA patents are obvious.</p>
<p>If Wells Fargo loses at trial, it will have an opportunity to appeal the ruling to an appeals court. Then either party could ask the Supreme Court to hear the case—though the nation's highest court agrees to hear only a tiny fraction of patent cases.</p>

<p>On Thursday it became official: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group are merging to become the world's fourth-largest automaker. Alfa Romeo, Citroën, Chrysler, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall will all now share a single corporate parent and merge operations. In a press release, Fiat Chrysler and PSA said that the 50:50 merger should save more than $4 billion (€3.7 billion) a year from "run-rate synergies without any plant closures."</p>
<p>Merging with another large automaker has been FCA's plan for a while. Before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/sergio-marchionne-the-man-who-saved-fiat-chyrsler-dies-at-66/">his untimely death</a>, Sergio Marchionne had conducted talks with many potential suitors, and earlier this year FCA was in active discussions with Renault. But those talks ultimately went nowhere, and now FCA will join up with France's other big automaker, PSA Group.</p>
<p>On the face of it, the merger makes a lot of sense. FCA has strong sales in the Americas and a decent portfolio of luxury brands and SUVs and trucks. PSA is strong in Europe, and its brands are better mainstream cars built using more modern architectures. PSA Group is also well ahead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/10-new-hybrid-and-electric-jeeps-by-2022-in-fiat-chryslers-five-year-plan/">FCA in terms of electrification</a>.</p>
<p>The new company, which has yet to be named, will be registered in the Netherlands, although it will "continue to maintain significant presences in the current operating head-office locations in France, Italy, and the US." PSA Group boss Carlos Tavares will be CEO of the 11-person board, with FCA's John Elkann as chair.</p>
<p>Based on 2018's results, the new company would have 8.7 million sales, combined revenues of $190 billion (€170 billion), and $12.3 billion in profit. However, from next year those profits are at risk from <a href="https://twitter.com/lovecarindustry/status/1113409912321847296">massive European Union fines</a> that await any OEM unable to get its fleet-wide emissions below 95g CO<sub>2</sub>/km. Earlier this year, we learned that FCA had entered into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/tesla-sells-european-emissions-law-lifeline-to-fiat-chrysler/">an agreement with Tesla</a>, where it would pay the US automaker "hundreds of millions" of dollars in order to count the American EVs as part of its European fleet.</p>
<p>But the new merged automaker will have a much larger pool of vehicles to take into account, as well as access to in-house BEVs that could be badge-engineered and sold at a profit. Perhaps the biggest loser in this merger could be Tesla, where a profitable quarter <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/tesla-made-a-profit-of-143-million-in-q3-2019-on-record-deliveries/">still depends on emissions credits</a>, not selling cars.</p>
<p>As for US car buyers, it's probably a little too soon to know what this will mean in terms of the cars we might be able to buy. PSA Group has wanted to return to the US market for a while, and in February news broke that Peugeot would lead that charge. But currently the company's sole US presence is a car-sharing service called Free2Move that operates in Washington, DC. I'd like to think modern American car buyers will take to quirky French crossovers with more enthusiasm than that which greeted a resurgent Alfa Romeo.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>AT&amp;T yesterday <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/new_unlimited_plans.html">announced</a> three new "unlimited" data plans. Keeping track of all the different limits on AT&amp;T's unlimited mobile plans is just as difficult as ever, but there's some good news for customers who use lots of smartphone data.</p>
<p>Buying AT&amp;T's cheapest unlimited plan still comes with the risk of getting your data throttled to speeds slower than those provided to other customers when the network is congested. The possible throttling can be imposed at any time, even if a customer hasn't used much data that month. But while upgrading to pricier plans currently only gives AT&amp;T customers 22GB a month before possible throttling, the plans coming out soon have options for at least 50GB or 100GB of un-throttled use.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's <a href="https://www.att.com/plans/unlimited-data-plans.html">current</a> entry-level plan is called "Unlimited &amp; More." It costs $70 per month for one line (not including taxes and fees), with the per-line prices descending with each additional line you buy. Each line costs $40 a month if you buy four lines.</p>
<p>It comes with a big restriction. "On AT&amp;T Unlimited &amp; More, for all data usage, customer[s] may temporarily experience reduced speeds on these line(s) during times of network congestion," AT&amp;T says. Customers aren't throttled to the same speed each time. Instead, these customers get slower speeds than customers who bought other plans when they're in a congested network area. Speeds are returned to normal if the network congestion clears up or if the customer moves to an un-congested location.</p>
<p>The Unlimited &amp; More plan also only includes SD video quality as video streams are throttled to 1.5Mbps, and mobile-hotspot usage is not allowed.</p>
<p>Starting November 3, AT&amp;T will offer a new "Unlimited Starter" plan as the entry-level edition at prices of $65 per month for a single line or $35 for each line when you buy four lines.</p>
<p>"You'll get unlimited calls, texts, and data, with the catch that AT&amp;T can throttle you whenever it decides that the network is too congested," The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940295/att-unlimited-plans-update-starter-extra-elite-data-mobile-cell-hbo-free-streaming">reported</a> yesterday. "Unlike the other plans, there's no guaranteed pool of data before deprioritizing starts. You're also limited to SD-quality video, and there's no option to share your Internet by using your phone as a mobile hotspot."</p>
<p>The throttling details weren't mentioned in <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/new_unlimited_plans.html">AT&amp;T's press release</a>, but AT&amp;T confirmed to Ars that the above details are correct.</p>
<h2>New premium options</h2>
<p>If you want mobile-hotspot usage, HD video streaming, and a guaranteed amount of data before you can be throttled, you have to pay more. With the current "Unlimited &amp; More Premium" plan that will soon be replaced, data can be throttled after you use 22GB in a month. This plan costs $80 per month for a single line and $48 per line if you buy four lines. The plan allows 15GB of high-speed mobile-hotspot use and HD streaming in 1080p.</p>
<p>Going forward, there will be two premium options instead. AT&amp;T Unlimited Extra, available November 3, will be $75 a month for a single line or $40 per line with four lines. The plan includes at least 50GB of data per month before you can be throttled during times of congestion, as well as 15GB of high-speed mobile-hotspot data. However, video is limited to SD.</p>
<p>The new top-level plan is Unlimited Elite, and AT&amp;T said it will launch "in the coming weeks" but did not reveal a specific release date. This one is $85 a month for a single line or $50 per line with four lines, and it comes with 100GB of data before any potential throttling. Unlimited Elite also has 30GB of high-speed mobile-hotspot data and HD-quality streaming video.</p>
<p>There are also changes in which video services come bundled with unlimited plans. Both of AT&amp;T's current unlimited plans come with AT&amp;T's WatchTV service, which has 35 channels of live TV. Unlimited &amp; More Premium also lets customers choose one of the following services: HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, Starz, Pandora Premium, Spotify Premium, and VRV.</p>
<p>The new unlimited plans will not include WatchTV and will not give customers a choice of entertainment services. However, Unlimited Elite will include HBO and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/hbo-max-will-bring-up-the-streaming-video-rear-in-may-2020-for-15mo/">HBO Max</a> when it is released in May 2020.</p>
<h2>AT&amp;T settlement with FTC is pending</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T's throttling of unlimited data plans used to be a lot more restrictive. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/att-finally-ramps-down-throttling-of-unlimited-lte-customers/">Until a change in 2015</a>, AT&amp;T customers who used 5GB of LTE data in a single monthly billing period were throttled for the rest of the month at all times, regardless of whether they were in a congested network area.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/us-sues-att-alleges-severe-throttling-of-unlimited-data-customers/">sued AT&amp;T in October 2014</a>, saying it misled consumers by promising unlimited data while imposing draconian throttling policies. The FTC and AT&amp;T recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-att-ftc-data/ftc-att-settle-2014-lawsuit-over-data-slowdowns-court-idUSKCN1VE01J">reached a tentative settlement</a>, but details of the deal haven't been made public yet. AT&amp;T is also facing a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/sorry-att-judge-says-throttled-customers-can-pursue-class-action/">class-action lawsuit</a> over the practice.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Nation-sponsored hackers have a new tool to drain telecom providers of huge amounts of SMS messages at scale, researchers said.</p>
<p>Dubbed "Messagetap" by researchers from the Mandiant division of security firm FireEye, the recently discovered malware infects Linux servers that route SMS messages through a telecom’s network. Once in place, Messagetap monitors the network for messages containing either a preset list of phone or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity">IMSI</a> numbers or a preset list of keywords.</p>
<p>Messages that meet the criteria are then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR</a> encoded and saved for harvesting later. FireEye said it found the malware infecting an undisclosed telecom provider. The company researchers said the malware is loaded by an installation script but didn’t otherwise explain how infections take place.</p>
<h2>Targeting upstream data sources</h2>
<p>The security firm said Messagetap belongs to APT41, one of several advanced persistent threat hacking groups that researchers say is sponsored by the Chinese government. The group is apparently using the malware to spy on high-ranking military and government officials. In a <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/messagetap-who-is-reading-your-text-messages.html">report</a>, the researchers said the malware allows China’s intelligence services to obtain a wide range of sensitive data at scale.</p>
<p>“The use of MESSAGETAP and targeting of sensitive text messages and call detail records at scale is representative of the evolving nature of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns observed by FireEye,” the researchers wrote. “APT41 and multiple other threat groups attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors have increased their targeting of upstream data entities since 2017. These organizations, located multiple layers above end-users, occupy critical information junctures in which data from multitudes of sources converge into single or concentrated nodes.”</p>
<p>Messagetap’s 64-bit Linux executable contains two configuration files. The first, <code>parm.txt</code>, contains lists of IMSI numbers and phone numbers of interest while <code>keyword_parm.txt</code> lists keywords. Both files are deleted from disk once loaded into memory. After that, Messagetap monitors all traffic passing over the network and looks for messages that match the criteria from the configuration text files. Messages sent to or from the phone or IMSI numbers are collected. Messages containing the keywords are also gathered. The malware parses all traffic at the Ethernet and IP layers and continues parsing protocol layers including SCTP, SCCP, and TCAP.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png"><img alt='An overview of Messagetap.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview-640x398.png" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png 2x" alt='An overview of Messagetap.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">An overview of Messagetap.</a> (credit: FireEye)</p></div>
<p>Researchers recovered the contents of the configuration files and found a “high volume of phone numbers and IMSI numbers.” Thursday’s report continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The inclusion of both phone and IMSI numbers show the highly targeted nature of this cyber intrusion. If an SMS message contained either a phone number or an IMSI number that matched the predefined list, it was saved to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor. The targeted phone numbers and IMSI numbers belonged to foreign high-ranking individuals of interest to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Similarly, the keyword list contained items of geopolitical interest for Chinese intelligence collection. Sanitized examples include the names of political leaders, military and intelligence organizations and political movements at odds with the Chinese government. If any SMS messages contained these keywords, MESSAGETAP would save the SMS message to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor.</p>
<p>In addition to MESSAGETAP SMS theft, Mandiant also identified the threat actor interacting with call detail record (CDR) databases to query, save and steal records for specific individuals during this same intrusion. Targeting CDR information provides a high-level overview of phone calls between individuals, including time, duration, and phone numbers.

<p>While Messagetap isn’t likely to have monitored the vast majority of the infected telecom’s users, its existence shows that network providers aren’t the only entities that can tap phone networks.

<p>Intel's years-long struggle with the 10nm manufacturing process may finally be over. The company told investors last week that its 10nm yields are ahead of expectations for both client and data center products—and it's bringing a new 10nm production facility online, as well. Currently, all 10nm parts are produced in two of the company's plants: Hillsboro, Oregon, and Kiryat Gat, Israel. But beginning next quarter, Intel's fabrication facility in Chandler, Arizona, will also be producing 10nm parts.</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields.png"><img alt='Intel claims 10nm yields are &quot;ahead of expectations&quot; even before bringing the 10nm fab in Arizona online.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields-640x362.png" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields-1280x724.png 2x" alt='Intel claims 10nm yields are &quot;ahead of expectations&quot; even before bringing the 10nm fab in Arizona online.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields.png"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">Intel claims 10nm yields are "ahead of expectations" even before bringing the 10nm fab in Arizona online.</a> (credit: Intel Corporation)</p></div>
<p>What we find more interesting than the 10nm recovery is that Intel still seems to be very serious about pivoting away from being a CPU company. Since 1991, the iconic "Intel Inside" logo has referred to the CPU in your computer, but the company sees more potential in investments in storage, software, networking, AI, and the data center.</p>
<p>This certainly doesn't mean Intel plans to exit the consumer and server CPU business, but it does herald a large shift in the company's overall focus. The company estimates the TAM—Total Addressable Market, or the maximum revenue if literally every potential customer bought an Intel product—of its traditional PC and server CPU line at $52 billion. However, it sees an additional $220 billion TAM potential in what it calls "Data-centric" products in data center, Internet of Things, and networking market segments.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/redefining-intel-inside-980x555.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          Intel wants to shift much of its focus away from the CPU and onto what it's dubbing the "XPU"—a term it's pushing which includes GPUs, FPGAs, and other more specialized processors.                      [credit:
                        <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel Corporation</a>

                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>This means the company intends to continue making its heaviest bets in areas such as Optane storage, hardware Artificial Intelligence acceleration, 5G modems, data center networking, and more. The slide that really drives this commitment home comes from Q2's investor meeting that explicitly shows the company moving from a "protect and defend" strategy to a growth strategy. If this slide were in a sales meeting, it wouldn't say much—but delivered to the company's investors, it gains a bit of gravitas.</p>
<p>Most of this was revealed nearly six months ago at the company's May 2019 investor's meeting, but the Q3 investor's meeting last week continues with and strengthens this story for Intel's future growth, with slides more focused on Optane, network, and IoT/Edge market growth than with the traditional PC and server market.</p>
<p>The company shows its new "data-centric" market as having already caught up with its traditional PC-centric market, with almost 50% of its Q3 revenue derived from data-centric products. The majority of the operating income (roughly speaking, profit) returns from those products is outpacing the traditional market as well.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">
          <li>
        <div class="gallery-item-content">  
        <div class="gallery-image"><img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/other-data-centric-revenue-q3-980x555.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>
          "Other data-centric business segments" refers in part to the company's Mobileye driver-assist and semi-autonomous vehicle business, as well as Optane and network gear.                      [credit:
                        <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel Corporation</a>

                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>We can confirm that Intel's change in focus seems sincere, based on what the company wants most to talk to Ars about. The company does still want to talk about CPUs, but there's an increasing pressure for coverage of its AI, networking, and even software efforts as the company shifts footing. We believe that this change in focus is likely a good one for consumers, assuming Intel finds the market growth it's looking for in new segments. With higher growth and margins in newer ventures, consumers can hope that Intel will make good on its stated intent to relax its protectionist stance in the CPU market along the way.</p>

<p>Apple's quarterly earnings calls have fallen into a predictable pattern for the past year or two: iPhone revenues are declining year-over-year, and the Mac mostly remains stagnant, but all of Apple's other businesses—wearables and services most notably—are ballooning.</p>
<p>That was the case again with <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">Apple's Q4 2019 earnings report</a> today; iPhones were down, but the company posted its highest revenue ever in a September quarter thanks to good performance from services like the App Store, AppleCare+, and Apple Pay, as well as strong iPad and Apple Watch sales. Total revenue was $64 billion.</p>
<p>Apple revealed during the proceedings that the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/iphone-11-review-the-sweet-spot-iphone/">iPhone 11</a> (sans <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-and-11-pro-max-review-high-quality-for-high-prices/">Pro</a>) is now its best-selling phone, and that iPhone revenue was $33 billion—a 9% decline over the same quarter the previous fiscal year, albeit an improvement over the 15% decline the company saw in the previous three quarters this year. (That improvement is very likely accounted for by the launch of the iPhone 11 and its ilk mid-September, just before the quarter ended.)</p>
<p>Mac sales were down 5%, but Apple CEO Tim Cook was quick to point out on the earnings call with investors that the company released a major update to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/apple-updates-entry-level-macbook-air-and-pro-discontinues-macbook/">MacBook Air</a>, one of its most popular computers, around this time last year but has not done so yet this year, ostensibly explaining some of the drop.</p>
<p>Apple is expected to refresh some of its laptops in the coming months and plans to imminently launch the pricy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/our-first-look-photos-of-the-apples-new-mac-pro-and-the-pro-display-xdr/">Mac Pro</a>. Aimed at creative professionals, the Mac Pro's price point makes it less of a mass-market device than the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Apple boasted 18% growth in services revenue, an improvement over the previous quarter that brings the 2019 fiscal year total to $46 billion. It was $12.5 billion for this quarter on its own. Among other things, this was credited to "all-time record revenues from payment services" like Apple Pay. The company alluded to the recent launches of Apple Card, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade, but it did not provide individual numbers for them during the call. Apple also said today that this was the best quarter ever for AppleCare.</p>
<p>The iPad saw 17% growth driven by the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/2018-ipad-pro-review-whats-a-computer/">iPad Pro</a>, but the big positive narrative from the company was that of wearables, which include Apple Watch and AirPods. The company saw 54% growth in that category, and the quarter in question ended before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a> were announced or released.</p>
<p>In an answer to an investor question, Cook let it be known that he sees wearables like the Watch and its associated health functionality as the future of the company. "There will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health," he said.</p>
<p>Some investors are understandably concerned that many of Apple's growth areas are dependent on the iPhone. Users are sticking with their existing iPhones and opting to go longer between upgrades than ever before, leading to ever-slowing iPhone sales. But Apple stock <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2019.html">rose</a> slightly after the call regardless, indicating that the market at least believes Apple still has plenty of room to grow in services and wearables in the near term before the iPhone's slowing momentum becomes a serious problem.</p>
<p>And in some cases, the numbers bear that out: a substantial portion of Apple's wearables revenue (which now stands toe-to-toe with the Mac) comes from customers making a first-time purchase in that category. And Cook again made vague allusions to major new products in the wearables category, which (not his words) could include the company's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-headset-with-a-new-os-report-says/">rumored augmented reality headset</a>.</p>
<p>Despite those declining iPhone sales, Apple users probably shouldn't be too concerned about the future of the ecosystem they've invested in. The company stated earlier this year that it has an install base of 900 million iPhones globally. Whether that continues to grow is a concern for investors looking for big returns in their portfolios, but not for users; an install base that size all but ensures continued support, content, and updates for many years yet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to Q1 2020, Apple projects revenue between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion—Q1 is often a big quarter for the company, as it carries holiday sales and much of the immediate post-launch revenue from the new iPhone lineup.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Unless you’d like to keep the pirate look going, it’s best to avoid costume contact lenses this Halloween.</p>
<p>Like every October, health authorities and medical organizations want to <a href="https://www.aoa.org/news/advocacy/decorative-contact-lenses-can-put-scare-into-halloween">remind you</a> that the decorative, over-the-counter lenses are not only <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/contact-lenses/decorative-contact-lenses-halloween-and-more">illegal</a>, they’re also <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contactlenses/keep-eyes-safe-halloween.html">terrible for your eyes</a>. And they're not telling tall tales. The lenses can cause infections, sores, scratches, vision-impairing scars, and even blindness. It’s easy to find eye-related horror stories from people who turned to black-market lenses to change the color, shape, or look of their eyes (some lenses even <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/7831901/Famous-and-infamous-sports-marketing-stunts.html?image=2">add logos</a> to your eyeballs).</p>
<p>Just on Tuesday, USA Today reported the case of a Cleveland woman who got decorative lenses <a href="https://www.today.com/health/woman-goes-er-remove-contact-lenses-stuck-eye-t165627">stuck to her eyeballs</a>. The lenses were supposed to turn her brown eyes blue but instead made them swollen and red. She had to have them removed in an emergency room.</p>
<p>Still, decorative lenses have proven incredibly popular. The color-contact-lens market has at times been valued at $300 million, accounting for 15% of the total market for contact lenses.</p>
<p>People tend to pick them up from street vendors, beauty salons, flea markets, and novelty shops. But selling them over the counter is actually illegal. Contact lenses are considered a medical device and are regulated as such by the Food and Drug Administration. Anyone buying them needs to have a prescription for the lenses.</p>
<p>The dodgy, black-market lenses often turn out be contaminated, irritating, or simply the wrong size for your eyeball, causing injuries. If they’re too small for your eye or don’t allow enough air through, the lenses can cut off oxygen to the cornea—the clear surface of the eye. This corneal hypoxia can allow infections to fester as well as cause damage the corneal tissue.</p>
<p>And that’s just one of many potential problems. Things get even more dicey when people fail to follow basic contact-care instructions—like cleaning them occasionally and not sleeping with them or sharing them (which can spread infections).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=16163010">a 2005 medical report</a>, a team of eye doctors laid out 12 consecutive cases of people arriving in medical centers with severe eye problems after using decorative lenses. The cases range from mild to extreme.</p>
<h2>Shiver me timbers</h2>
<p>Patient 1 was a 16-year-old girl who showed up with eye pain and redness after wearing a colored lens. She admitted to sleeping with the lenses as well as sharing them with her younger brother. Doctors treated her with artificial tears and an antibiotic ointment, and her symptoms quickly improved.</p>
<p>Patient 12, on the other hand, was not so lucky. After buying cat-eye lenses at a flea market, the 26-year-old man developed a severe, painful infection called <em>Acanthamoeba</em> keratitis. The infection is caused by a free-living amoeba running rampant in the cornea, which can be blinding—as it was in this case.  He ended up needing a corneal transplant, and three months afterwards his vision was still 20/200, which is considered legally blind.</p>
<p>Patient 11 also suffered permanent vision loss. The 39-year-old woman went to the doctor with pain, redness, and blurred vision in her left eye after buying colored lenses at a hair salon. Her ophthalmologist quickly spotted an ulcer in the center of her cornea, which was positive for the pathogenic bacteria <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. She was admitted to the hospital for intensive antibiotic therapy. But two months later, her best corrected vision in the affected eye was only 20/50.</p>
      <ul class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide">

        <div class="gallery-item-content">

        <p>
          Patient 9, a 16-year-old girl who bought colored lenses at a flea market, had a central corneal ulcer positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.                      [credit:
                        <a href="https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=16163010">Steinemann et al.</a>
                        ]
                  </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>Things could have been much worse for Patient 11 if she had been in the same boat as Patient 2. While Patient 11 told doctors that she regularly cleaned her black-market lenses, Patient 2—a 16-year-old girl—kept hers in dirty cases with obvious debris and continued to use them after doctors told her to stop.</p>
<p>When doctors analyzed the lenses, they found multiple bacteria normally found in the intestines (and feces) including <em>Klebsiella</em> species, <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</em> Two lenses also contained acanthamoeba—the amoeba that caused Patient 12’s blindness. One lens was positive for a fungal <em>Fusarium</em> species. The lens solutions and cases were positive for bacteria <em>Serratia marcescens</em>, <em>Serratia fonticola</em>, and <em>Klebsiella</em> species.</p>
<p>Patient 2 was seen multiple times for persistent infection and irritation but stopped going to appointments after six weeks.</p>
<p>Such poor hygiene and care practices can cause eye infections and damage with any type of contact lens. But doing so with sketchy fashion lenses is particularly dangerous.</p>
<p>If you really want to change the look of your eye, the FDA emphasizes that it’s very important to buy <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/contact-lenses/list-contact-lenses">FDA-approved decorative lenses</a> through your eye doctor or another reputable vendor—with your prescription.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/while-one-texas-county-shook-off-ransomware-small-cities-took-full-punch/">more than 20 local governments in Texas</a> were hit this summer by ransomware in one day. The attack was apparently tracked back to one thing the organizations had in common: a managed service provider. With limited IT resources of their own, local governments have increasingly turned to MSPs to operate significant portions of their networks and applications, as have other organizations and businesses—often placing critical parts of their business operations in the MSPs' hands. And that has made MSPs a very attractive target to ransomware operators.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.armor.com/reports/new-msps-%20compromised-reports-armor">Threat researchers at the global cloud security provider Armor</a> have been tracking publicly-reported incidents in which MSP and cloud service providers have been hit with ransomware. Thus far, they have documented 13 such incidents this year—with 6 of them reported in the past few months.</p>
<p>The most recent publicly exposed victim is Billtrust, which as<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/10/ransomware-hits-b2b-payments-firm-billtrust/"> security journalist Brian Krebs reported,</a> was hit by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/billing-provider-billtrust-suffers-outage-after-malware-attack/">what BleepingComputer reported was BitPaymer ransomware</a> (a report that has not been confirmed). BillTrust is an online invoicing and billing provider based in New Jersey that also provides credit decision services. Billtrust executives sent an email to customers on October 22, informing them of the attack, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our standard security and back-up procedures have been and remain instrumental in our ability to execute the ongoing restoration of services... Out of an abundance of caution, we cannot disclose the precise ransomware strains but will do so as soon as prudently possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other victims include:</p>
<ul>
<li>SchoolinSites, a cloud-based service provider for school districts that offered websites and parental access to student information, <a href="https://www.wkrg.com/news/mcpss-website-hacked-by-virus/">was taken down in an attack in September</a> as reported by WKRG in Mobile, Alabama. The company's email was affected as well as other communications; SchoolinSites had to use Facebook to provide updates during the outage, which began on September 23.</li>
<li>TrialWorks, a Florida-based case management software provider, was <a href="https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2019/10/ransomware-attack-reportedly-hits-practice-management-company-locking-lawyers-out-of-their-case-files.html">hit by a ransomware attack the week of October 14.</a> The company, which serves about 2,500 law firms, acknowledged the ransomware attack and said that, while it did not impact their software, about 5% of the company's customers could not access their accounts.</li>
<li><a href="https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2019/06/13/calif-mls-giant-temporarily-shuts-down-after-malware-attack">California-based MetroList,</a> a real estate multiple listing and application services firm with about 20,000 real estate broker customers, was hit by ransomware in June, taking the company's services offline for two days. MetroList reportedly paid the ransom, which included a $10,000 insurance deductible.</li>
<li>Also on October 14, <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/ascension/article_b6194b7a-eba2-11e9-a388-5b6eedc7c596.html">Magnolia Pediatrics of Prairieville, Louisiana</a>, was reportedly hit by ransomware via the practice's managed IT services provider. Magnolia reported the ransomware to law enforcement.</li>
<li>In July, CorVel, a managed service provider for insurance companies handling workers compensation, auto, health, and disability claims, <a href="https://www.joepaduda.com/2019/07/26/corvels-problem-may-be-ransomware/">got hit by Ryuk ransomware</a>. As the company responded, systems used to process claims, email and phone systems, and healthcare provider databases were taken offline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Organizations using full-service IT-managed service providers, such as Magnolia Pediatrics, are particularly at risk because the security of all of their systems is dependent on that of the MSP. As was the case in Texas, this meant that all their data was put at risk. In Magnolia's case, all patient data was encrypted, but it could just as easily have been stolen by attackers—and since that data includes personal identifying data for children, it could have significant long-term consequences. A clinic spokesperson said that "out of an abundance of caution," Magnolia advised patients' families to monitor credit card statements and credit bureau reports.</p>
<p>These issues are why having a conversation (and a contract) with a service provider that includes security is so important.</p>

<p>Twitter might be the president's favored platform and a valued way for candidates to spread their messages far and wide, but starting next month, elected officials and candidates alike are going to have to make sure all that traffic comes organically. That's because they won't be allowed to pay for political advertising.</p>
<p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has apparently taken a look at the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/no-you-apparently-cant-run-for-office-just-to-put-false-ads-on-facebook/">controversy</a> currently embroiling Facebook and decided he wants no part of it.</p>
<p>"We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally," Dorsey announced in, naturally, <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1189634377057067008">a tweet</a>. </p>
<p>He framed the choice as an opportunity for anyone with a message, rather than a penalty, adding, "A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money."</p>
<p>The ban applies not only to candidates and their campaigns but also to "issue ads" by any group, Dorsey continued, since those "present a way to circumvent" the ban on political advertising and would present a situation where "everyone but candidates" could pay to have their view on an issue promoted. He also added an apparent dig at Facebook:</p>
<blockquote><p>For instance, it's not credible for us to say: "We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad... well...they can say whatever they want! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />"</p></blockquote>
<p>"This isn't about free expression," Dorsey went on. "This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address."</p>
<h2>Direct challenge</h2>
<p>The stance comes in direct opposition to social media leader Facebook, which explicitly exempts both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/facebook-confirms-its-standards-dont-apply-to-politicians/">posts</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/political-ads-can-lie-if-they-want-facebook-confirms/">advertisements</a> made by politicians from its community standards and fact-checking process. </p>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly doubled down on his company's position amid a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers, political candidates, and even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebooks-new-political-ad-policy-already-showing-cracks-loopholes/">employees</a>. In a congressional hearing last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) directly challenged Zuckerberg on the company's policy.</p>
<p>"Do you see a potential problem here with the complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?" Ocasio-Cortez asked.</p>
<p>"Well, congresswoman, I think lying is bad," Zuckerberg replied. "I think if you're gonna lie, that would be bad." But that would be different from preventing people from "seeing that you had lied," he tried to explain.</p>
<p>"So you will take down lies, or you won't take down lies? I think this is a pretty simple yes or no," she pressed.</p>
<p>"In a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote down are saying," he answered. Any actions Facebook might take "depends on the context" in which a dishonest piece of content is posted, he added.</p>

<p>Apple yesterday released software updates for macOS and watchOS—10.15.1 and 6.1, respectively. Apple's habit of late has been to release most of its operating system updates for each platform all on the same day. But in this instance, though, macOS and watchOS came a single day after iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS updates.</p>
<p>The macOS update mainly adds features we already saw yesterday in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-and-ipados-13-2/">iOS and iPadOS 13.2</a>. That includes support for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/">AirPods Pro</a>, the ability to opt in or out of sharing Siri recordings with Apple, new emoji, and new HomeKit feature support. There are also a number of macOS-specific bug fixes and the restoration of some lost Photos features.</p>
<p>Here are Apple's update notes for macOS Catalina 10.15.1:</p>
<blockquote><p>The macOS Catalina 10.15.1 update includes updated and additional emoji, support for AirPods Pro, HomeKit Secure Video, HomeKit enabled routers, and new Siri privacy settings, as well as bug fixes and improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Emoji</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Over 70 new or updated emoji, including animals, food, activities, new accessibility emoji, gender-neutral emoji, and skin tones selection for couple emoji</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AirPods</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introduces support for AirPods Pro</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Home app</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HomeKit Secure Video enables you to privately capture, store, and view encrypted video from your security cameras and features people, animal, and vehicle detection</li>
<li>HomeKit-enabled routers let you control how your HomeKit accessories communicate over the Internet or in your home</li>
<li>Adds support for AirPlay 2-enabled speakers in scenes and automations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Siri</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy settings to control whether or not to help improve Siri and Dictation by allowing Apple to store audio of your Siri and Dictation interactions</li>
<li>Option to delete your Siri and Dictation history from Siri Settings</li>
</ul>
<p>This update also includes the following bug fixes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restores the ability to view file names in the All Photos view in Photos</li>
<li>Restores the ability to filter by favorites, photos, videos, edited, and keywords in Days view in Photos</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where Messages would only send a single notification when the option to repeat alerts was enabled</li>
<li>Resolves an issue that caused Contacts to launch to the previously opened contact instead of the contact list</li>
<li>Adds a two-finger swipe gesture for back navigation in Apple News</li>
<li>Resolves issues that may occur in the Music app when displaying playlists inside folders and newly added songs in the Songs list</li>
<li>Improves reliability of migrating iTunes library databases into the Music, Podcasts, and TV apps</li>
<li>Fixes an issue where downloaded titles were not visible in the Downloads folder in the TV app</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>watchOS 6.1 is a very small update; its main purpose appears to be AirPods Pro support; users can now manage their active-noise-cancelation settings via the Watch for the new earphones. Additionally, Apple has brought watchOS 6 to the series 1 and series 2 Apple Watch devices as previously promised. (They were not supported by the first release of watchOS 6.)</p>
<p>Here are Apple's brief watchOS 6.1 update notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>watchOS 6.1 introduces support for ‌AirPods Pro‌ and includes improvements and bug fixes. This update also brings ‌watchOS 6‌ to ‌Apple Watch‌ Series 1 and Series 2.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Apple released a security update labeled watchOS 5.3.3 for Apple Watches not running watchOS 6. This is necessary even though watchOS 6 supports all Watch models now because watchOS 6 only works with iPhones that can run iOS 13, but some users are on older handsets.</p>
<p>Both updates should be available to all users today.</p>

<p>Personality tests are two a penny, and most of them are no more meaningful than astrology (spoken like a true Capricorn). But there are ways to study personality empirically—they just involve accepting a lot of imperfection and fuzziness.</p>
<p>The "Big Five" personality traits do seem to get at something meaningful about human personality. They certainly don't capture everything, but Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism are traits that can be measured with a high degree of stability from one test to the next. They change in predictable ways across people's lifespans and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/meta-analysis-shows-psychotherapy-leads-to-long-term-personality-change/">with therapy</a>, and they seem to be related in measurable ways to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/programmers-are-a-tiny-bit-introverted-but-otherwise-agreeable/">people's lives</a> outside the context of a personality test.</p>
<p>One of those traits—conscientiousness—is, unsurprisingly, strongly related to how people perform at work. But why, and in what settings? A paper published this week in PNAS used the data from more than 2,500 studies to summarize what we know about conscientiousness. Unexpectedly, the authors find that conscientiousness scores make less of a difference to people's performance when they're in high-complexity careers. Instead, they mainly seems to matter in low- or moderate-complexity jobs.</p>
<h2>More than just being neat</h2>
<p>Human personality is, obviously, an incredibly tricky thing to measure. People's personalities are somewhat stable from one week or month to the next, but how they're feeling on the day of the test will obviously change their answers to an extent. And the phenomenon of personality itself is obviously incredibly complex.</p>
<p>So a Big Five personality test doesn't try to carve people into distinct categories—either an extrovert or an introvert, agreeable or not. Instead, it places people on a sliding scale relative to other people on each of the five traits. You could be in the top 30% of extraverted people but still know people more extraverted than you.</p>
<p>Each trait breaks down into different facets that try to capture different components of it. The questions used to assess conscientiousness tap into a combination of someone's orderliness, cautiousness, self-discipline, dutifulness, achievement-striving, and a facet called "self-efficacy" (which is related to behaviors like finishing tasks properly). Together, these facets all get at slightly different angles of what it means to be "conscientious."</p>
<p>The Big Five traits offer a way of capturing people's personalities that is obviously imperfect, but  they still have a meaningful connection with how people behave in the real world. If you take a group of 1,000 people and test their conscientiousness and then their job performance, you'll find that higher conscientiousness and higher job performance go hand in hand. If you then randomly pull one very conscientious person out of the 1,000, there's a reasonably good chance (but no certainty!) that they'll do well at a job.</p>
<p>Measuring conscientiousness is obviously handy for employers trying to figure out who to employ. To cut through the variability inherent in individual studies, researchers Michael Wilmot and Deniz Ones threw together a huge amount of data from hundreds of studies to get a more precise estimate on how and why conscientiousness matters.</p>
<h2>Creatures of habit</h2>
<p>Wilmot and Ones went a step beyond using a meta-analysis and performed a meta-meta-analysis. They used 92 meta-analyses, which pulled data from more than 2,500 studies and more than a million participants. This should provide an unusually precise estimate of just how much conscientiousness matters.</p>
<p>Results from the huge dataset showed that conscientiousness was strongly related to positive work behaviors. For instance, people high in conscientiousness were good at setting goals and avoiding procrastination. They were less aggressive and less irresponsible than people with low conscientiousness.</p>
<p>But there were some results that won't sound quite so obvious. For instance, conscientiousness is related to conformity and security, so a "preference for more predictable environments" was a strong theme in the results, the researchers write.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, conscientiousness seemed to make more of a difference in some careers than others. In jobs that were high in complexity, it didn't make much of a difference at all. Meanwhile, in jobs that were moderate in complexity, like customer service and sales, conscientiousness made a much bigger difference.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that high-complexity jobs, which require creative problem solving, aren't necessarily a great match for highly conscientious people who want structure and predictability in their work. But it might also be that complex jobs tend to attract conscientious people, and so everyone in those professions is already pretty high in conscientiousness, with less difference among them. Another possibility is that there are jobs where high conscientiousness is a minimum threshold for making it in and just one of a suite of traits that are necessary for doing well, says Marcus Credé, who researches conscientiousness but wasn't involved in the paper.</p>
<h2>Personality change</h2>
<p>The paper does a great job of pulling together a mountain of evidence on what researchers have suspected about conscientiousness, says Credé, but there are some caveats. The research itself isn't weak, but measuring people's personalities is just incredibly tricky. If you test someone's conscientiousness while they're filling in a job application, they're obviously going to presenting themselves in a certain way—so their answers will reflect not just their actual conscientiousness, but also their awareness of what an employer will be looking for.</p>
<p>Wilmot and Ones suggest that it would be a good idea to try improving conscientiousness in schoolkids. Credé, though, isn't so sure. Conscientiousness does tend to increase with age, but changing it intentionally is a different matter. "I'm not aware of any particularly successful intervention program," he says.</p>
<p>It's possible that some of the facets of conscientiousness could respond to training, he adds—safety training, for instance, could possibly increase people's cautiousness. But "getting someone to be more achievement-striving? It'd be lovely if you could! You could make a lot of money if you could figure that out."</p>

<p>Facebook about a month ago confirmed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/facebook-confirms-its-standards-dont-apply-to-politicians/">politicians are exempt</a> from its speech policies and ad standards. That policy frees up holders of political jobs, and candidates seeking those jobs, to, basically, lie their entire faces off in Facebook ads if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>The Internet and the 21st century being what they are, of course, many people greeted this news with responses along the lines of: "Does that mean I can just sign up for any local race and then put any ads I want on Facebook?" One man decided to find out. And so far, at least, the answer seems to be: No. </p>
<p>Adriel Hampton lives in California and runs a digital marketing firm that promotes progressive causes. On Monday, he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/facebook-false-ads-california-governor/index.html">formally registered</a> as a candidate for the state's gubernatorial race, and his <a href="https://civichall.org/civicist/op-ed-its-time-to-challenge-techs-power-at-the-ballot-box/">stated platform</a> explicitly challenges both President Donald Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>His plan, he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/facebook-false-ads-california-governor/index.html">told CNN</a>, was to use his new status as a political candidate to buy ads on Facebook promoting false content about Trump, Zuckerberg, and others explicitly to call attention to Facebook's policies and force the company to change them.</p>
<h2>Who’s a politician?</h2>
<p>Hampton's bid to become the Golden State's next head honcho isn't his first foray into challenging Facebook's ad policies. In fact, it's not even his first headline-grabbing Facebook-related action in the last week.</p>
<p>Hampton also runs a political action committee, The Really Online Lefty League (TROLL), which a few days ago lived up to its name by purchasing a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook/facebook-takes-down-false-ad-from-pac-on-republican-graham-idUSKBN1X50IZ">stunt advertisement</a> claiming Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) supports the Green New Deal, a progressive policy package and the signature proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y). </p>
<p>Graham, who is a devoted Republican, is as ardent an opponent of the Green New Deal as you might expect and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/28/blog-posting/no-lindsey-graham-does-not-support-green-new-deal/">has said</a>: "There's not one Republican going to vote for anything coming out of the Green New Deal 'cause it’s crazy."</p>
<p>Facebook suspended the ad's paid distribution. It said that—because the promotion came from a third-party PAC rather than directly from a candidate or politician—it was eligible for review and removal under the site's policy.</p>
<p>Launching a campaign doesn't appear to be enough to make Hampton a legitimately exempt advertiser in Facebook's eyes, though. Facebook <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/tech/facebook-california-candidate-false-ads/index.html">told CNN</a>, "This person has made clear he registered as a candidate to get around our policies, so his content, including ads, will continue to be eligible for third-party fact-checking."</p>
<p>Hampton responded to CNN that Facebook, "made a policy specific to me, and I am running for California governor to regulate Facebook," adding, "I am going to look at suing them—I will immediately seek all available legal options."</p>
<h2>Beyond stunts</h2>
<p>The fight around what Facebook does or does not allow on its site is already beyond exhausting—but it's almost certainly going to get worse before (or if) it manages to get better. US politicians on all sides are wading into the fray, and with the 2020 election <em>almost</em> finally less than a year away, tensions are only going to intensify.</p>
<p>The current fight over political ads on Facebook began when President Donald Trump's re-election campaign <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/political-ads-can-lie-if-they-want-facebook-confirms/">ran a false ad</a> about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is among the leading candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The site refused to pull the spot, kicking off outrage, especially from Biden's fellow Democrats.</p>
<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another leading contender in the crowded 2020 field, herself <a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1183019880867680256?lang=en">launched a false ad</a> on Facebook earlier this month to draw attention to what she sees as the platform's failings. "Breaking news," the ad begins: "Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election."</p>
<p>It immediately reveals the deception as it goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, "how could this possibly be true?"</p>
<p>Well, it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is give Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform—and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Facebook inexplicably used its official news twitter account to <a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1183162508846215168">challenge Warren</a>, comparing itself to legacy TV broadcasters, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Facebook, however, is not subject to regulation by the FCC—nor would company leadership particularly want it to be, one assumes.</p>
<p>"You're making my point here," Warren responded. "It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards."</p>
<p>Investigations by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/28/pro-trump-super-pacs-draw-scrutiny-facebook-ads-seeking-voter-registration-data/">The Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-latinos-analysis/vamos-to-victory-trumps-spanish-ads-skirt-immigration-warn-of-socialism-idUSKBN1X913E">Reuters</a>, and others, meanwhile, show that questionable political advertising by third parties is not only rampant, but also can stay up on Facebook until media attention causes the company to pull it down.</p>
<p>Employees, meanwhile, are reportedly <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebooks-new-political-ad-policy-already-showing-cracks-loopholes/">no happier with the contentious policy than anyone else</a>: more than 250 Facebook workers have signed onto an open letter asking the company to adopt new standards for political ads.</p>

<p>A day after Facebook-owned WhatsApp sued NSO Group, the social media platform has deleted the accounts of employees who work at the Israel-based spyware maker, according to message boards and a security researcher who spoke to one worker.</p>
<p>"Your account has been deleted for not following our terms," said a message sent to one employee by Facebook-owned Instagram. "You won't be able to log into this account, and no one else will be able to see it. We're unable to restore accounts that are deleted for these types of violations."</p>

<p>The action comes after WhatsApp <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/whatsapp-suit-says-israeli-spyware-maker-exploited-its-app-to-infect-1400-users/">sued NSO Group on Tuesday</a> for allegedly mass exploiting a critical vulnerability that targeted 1,400 devices with spyware. WhatsApp presented evidence that about 100 of the targets were lawyers, dissidents, human-rights advocates, and other members of civil society. The exploits allowed the attackers to install spyware on iOS and Android phones simply by making a video call to the device.</p>
<p>According to WhatsApp, the attackers made the calls from WhatsApp accounts that were created for the purpose of infecting other WhatsApp users. The attackers also relied on WhatsApp servers to communicate with NSO-operated attack servers. The actions, WhatsApp said, violated not just its terms of service, but also the US Computer and Fraud Abuse Act.</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks, among other things, a permanent injunction barring all NSO employees from "accessing or attempting to access WhatsApp's or Facebook's services, platform, and computer systems."</p>
<p>A message board popular in Israel indicated that the deletion was widespread. "I had just personally verified it (I have friends working there)," one person <a href="https://rotter.net/forum/scoops1/582511.shtml#14">wrote</a>. "Ninety-eight percent of the company employees were blocked."</p>
<p>Another person who claimed to work at NSO responded to say he or she hadn't been blocked. Another person claiming to be an NSO employee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brennerguy_facebook-instagram-nso-activity-6595220156459307008-OKok/">complained bitterly on LinkedIn</a>. An Israel-based security researcher who spoke to an NSO employee said the deletions affected a much smaller percentage of the company's employees and didn't involve WhatsApp accounts.</p>
<p>After this post went live, a Facebook representative said people whose accounts were deleted will have an opportunity to appeal the move and potentially have their accounts restored. NSO representatives declined to comment.</p>
<p><em>Post updated to remove the words "permanent" and "permanently" after Facebook said the deletions are subject to an appeal process.</em> </p>

<p>AT&amp;T is planning to spend just $20 billion on capital investment in 2020, down from $23 billion this year.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T announced the $20 billion forecast for 2020 Monday in its <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2019/att_third_quarter_earnings_2019.html">quarterly earnings</a>. A year ago, <a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2018/4q-2018/4Q18%20Earnings%20Release.pdf">AT&amp;T said</a> it would spend $23 billion on gross capital investment in 2019. (These numbers include network construction and vendor-financing payments but do not include some spending on AT&amp;T's FirstNet public safety network, which is reimbursed by the federal government.)</p>
<p>The company is on pace to exceed its 2019 goal as it averaged <a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/3Q19_Trending%20Schedules.pdf">more than $6 billion per quarter</a> in the first three quarters. But with a forecast of $20 billion across all of 2020, AT&amp;T expects to spend about $5 billion per quarter on capital investments going forward. The company is under pressure from investors to control spending, in part because its TV business is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/att-loses-another-1-3-million-tv-customers-as-directv-freefall-continues/">tanking</a> and because of AT&amp;T's giant debt load stemming from the purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T increased capital investment between 2018 and 2019, but its 2020 outlook would push the company's spending to lower than its 2018 total of $21.8 billion. AT&amp;T, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/att-promised-7000-new-jobs-to-get-tax-break-it-cut-23000-jobs-instead/">as you might remember</a>, promised increased capital spending and thousands of new jobs in exchange for a corporate tax cut and <a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/108302543725436/AT%26T%20reply%20comments%2017-108.pdf">claimed</a> that the now-repealed federal net neutrality rules harmed broadband-network investment. The tax cut alone <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-sees-big-benefit-from-tax-law-1517434789">reportedly</a> gave AT&amp;T an extra $3 billion in cash in 2018, and it continues to give the company <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-corporate-income-tax-work">lower tax rates</a> each year. Despite that, AT&amp;T <a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/3Q19_Investor%20Briefing.pdf">said</a> it has cut its workforce from 269,280 employees to 251,840 employees in the past year.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's capital spending will decline next year despite the company's plan to roll 5G mobile service out nationwide. AT&amp;T already got much of the 5G spending out of the way by purchasing spectrum licenses, and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson <a href="https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/ATT%203Q19%20Transcript.pdf">told investors</a> that the company's "strong spectrum position will allow for lower capital intensity" over the next three years.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T has also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/att-cuts-another-1800-jobs-as-it-finishes-fiber-internet-buildout/">mostly stopped</a> its fiber-to-the-home broadband construction even though large portions of its 21-state territory still have only copper-based DSL service. Fiber deployment isn't stopping completely, as Stephenson said that "5G requires us to continue deploying fiber." But AT&amp;T customers who can't get modern broadband speeds or reliable wireline service in their homes would welcome more capital investment in their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's capital investment has an outsized influence on the industry numbers as a whole. As Stephenson said, the $20 billion AT&amp;T plans in 2020 is "the most aggressive investment in the industry" even though it's low by AT&amp;T's recent standards.</p>
<h2>Tax cut, deregulation didn't boost investment</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T slashing $3 billion off its capital investment will hurt Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai's attempts to claim that his deregulatory initiatives have raised broadband investment. Pai has repeatedly <a href="//cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pai-capital.pdf">cited capital-expenditure numbers</a> in his <a href="https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0426/DOC-344590A1.pdf">argument</a> that net neutrality rules caused broadband providers to reduce investment.</p>
<p>Pai has also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/ajit-pai-says-broadband-access-is-soaring-and-that-hes-the-one-to-thank/">taken credit</a> for AT&amp;T's fiber-to-the-home deployment, even though AT&amp;T completed that multi-year project as part of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/att-gets-directv-merger-approval-must-deploy-fiber-to-12-5m-customers/">deal with Pai's predecessor</a>, Tom Wheeler. AT&amp;T's decisions to lower capital investment and stop expanding fiber-to-the-home broadband may force Pai to look elsewhere for data to support his deregulatory preferences.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T's lower-than-expected spending forecast for 2020 "surprised Wall Street analysts," <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/atandt-and-verizon-are-stingy-on-capex-despite-5g-deployments/d/d-id/755244">Light Reading reported today</a>. "The reduction was such that the analysts at Wall Street research firm Cowen lowered their capex forecasts for AT&amp;T to roughly $19 billion in 2021 and 2022, a decrease from their previous forecast of around $21 billion," the article said.</p>
<h2>Comcast, Charter cut cable spending</h2>
<p>Capital expenditures for other carriers are also lower than expected. "Comcast and Charter missed 3Q expectations for capex and guided 2019 lower than previously planned," analysts at Nomura's Instinet wrote in a note to investors, according to Light Reading. "We have lowered our combined 2019 capex forecast for Comcast and Charter from $14.6 billion to $14.2 billion."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-3rd-quarter-2019-results">Comcast said</a> its cable division's capital expenditures "decreased 6.7% to $1.8 billion" in the quarter." For the nine months ending September 30, Comcast cable's "capital expenditures decreased 11.7% to $4.8 billion," the company said. (Comcast's overall capital expenditures increased because of a rise in NBCUniversal spending.)</p>
<p><a href="https://ir.charter.com/static-files/76cf320f-4610-448b-9768-c1a27f2d2c2e">Charter said</a> that its third-quarter "capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion compared to $2.1 billion during the third quarter of 2018."</p>
<p>"Charter currently expects capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures related to mobile, to be slightly below $7 billion in 2019, versus $8.9 billion in 2018," the company said.</p>
<p>Verizon spent $4.4 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter, "roughly $100 million below most Wall Street expectations," but Verizon still expects to hit its full-year forecast of $17 billion to $18 billion in 2019, Light Reading wrote.</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>COLUMBIA, Md.—In a business park that plays home to a number of tech and cybersecurity firms situated strategically between Washington, DC, and Baltimore, there's a two-story building that looks externally like many other office buildings, remarkable this day only for the food trucks in the parking lot and the stream of people in camouflage swarming in and out. The building, called <a href="https://dreamport.tech/index.php">DreamPort</a>, is a collaboration facility leased by US Cyber Command—and on October 18, it was the location of <a href="https://www.avengercon.com/">AvengerCon IV</a>, the latest incarnation of a soldier-led cybersecurity training event that takes the shape of a community hacking conference.</p>
<p>The event also offered USCYBERCOM a chance to show off DreamPort—and a chance for me to meet with <a href="https://www.cybercom.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Display/Article/1651709/executive-director-uscybercom/">David Luber</a>, the Executive Director of USCYBERCOM.</p>
<p>"AvengerCon is an event that is attracting the very best talent both from our DoD participants and also from some of the folks that are working with us outside of the DoD," Luber said. "When you bring those very best cyber experts together, they get to learn, test out new ideas, and work in an environment that is hosted by and for DoD cyber operations community experts. They're working in a community of peers—they get to learn together, they get to fail together. And what we've seen from previous activities with AvengerCon is that it's an exhilarating, fun environment for them to work in, and they learn a ton while they're here. And the private sector benefits because as AvengerCon shows, we're all working on some of the same cyber challenges together."</p>
<p>AvengerCon is an effort to bring the learning environment provided by security conferences such as DEFCON to a military and government community that wouldn't otherwise be available because of cost and bureaucratic complexity. Originally a training event organized by the 781st Military Intelligence Battalion at Fort Meade involving about 100 soldiers, AvengerCon has grown to 600 attendees and has gained the backing of Army Cyber Command and USCYBERCOM.</p>

<p>"My job, in part, is trying to figure out how to properly train soldiers in a field that doesn't have decades of standard operating procedures and clear paths for training to get to success," Capt. Joseph Dooley, an organizer of AvengerCon, told Ars. He said that this type of event offered "a unique opportunity for soldiers to individually be in a more unstructured environment where they can set their own agenda"—where they can pick things that they're interested in or feel they need training in without the usual constraints of formal Army training.</p>
<p>The event "complements efforts in regular unit training," Dooley explained. "And it gives [attendees] the chance to collaborate with subject-matter experts [and] share and compare tradecraft, best practices, and ideas. This is a very good way to boost our other conventional training."</p>
<p>Sgt. 1st Class Craig Seiler, another member of the AvengerCon organizing committee, said that bringing together people from across the cyber operations community in government provided a boost to the learning opportunities. "What we've found is mixing all these different types of people—developers, people doing operations—they all do great things separately, but when they get together later on, they say, 'Hey, I really learned something from that analyst or that developer that I've picked up to bring to my current job.'"</p>
<p>I attended last year's AvengerCon, held on Fort Meade, at the invitation of the unit organizing the event, the 780th Military Intelligence Brigade (Cyber). While AvengerCon III was clearly a success, this year's expanded event puts AvengerCon on the scale of well-established regional security conferences. The keynote speaker was security researcher Daniel Cuthbert, who is Global Head of Cyber Security Research for Grupo Santander and co-author of the original Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide and the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard. He spoke largely on the issues surrounding information-sharing and collaboration in the cybersecurity realm.</p>
<h2>Beyond the base</h2>

      </li>
      </ul>
  

<p>Holding a "con" on a military post (and at Fort Meade in particular) can pose some logistical challenges—such as getting people cleared and onto the base itself, and limited space to stage the event. Fortunately, the success of AvengerCon drew the attention of US Cyber Command, and the organizers were offered the use of DreamPort for the event's next iteration.</p>
<p>AvengerCon fits neatly into DreamPort's mission to foster collaboration between US Cyber Command, the rest of the Department of Defense and intelligence community, and industry.</p>
<p>"We opened the facility here in Columbia, Maryland, back in the fall of 2018," Luber said, "created under a partnership intermediary agreement between US Cyber Command and the Maryland Innovation and Security Institute [MISI]. We've hosted over 14,000 visitors in this 40,000-square-foot facility, and in June of 2019, MISI signed an expansion lease to double the size of DreamPort by the end of 2020. So, we're really happy about the partnership that we've had so far."</p>
<p>Companies and individuals can come into the unclassified facility to demonstrate capabilities during "challenges" and events hosted by the facility looking at specific cybersecurity issues. These include critical infrastructure security events simulated in "Dream Valley," a scale model village connected to actual industrial control systems and other operational technology.</p>
<h2>Off base</h2>
<p>DreamPort's planned expansion is probably a good thing, considering how AvengerCon has grown. In the past, the event was limited to Army personnel, but now it includes attendees from across the Department of Defense and other government agencies tied to cyber operations, as well as students and representatives of industry.</p>
<p>"We felt we needed to branch out and start making sure that we are supporting the community better each year as we expand," said Seiler. "The growth is great, but it also brings in other woes and requirements." The logistics of getting people onto Fort Meade was one of them, Seiler explained—while it provided a natural level of security around the event, using the base made drawing on outside resources difficult and limited who could be brought in to attend.</p>
<p>"We found it works better if it's off base," he said.</p>
<p>Using DreamPort opened up the opportunity to add resources provided by outside organizations that "connect to our mission," Seiler said. Those included the "villages" at the event brought in by security community organizations—including ICS Village's industrial control systems "capture the flag" competition (in which attendees looked for ways to compromise simulated plant hardware) and the Voting Village's collection of voting-machine hardware and exploration of election security.</p>
<p>"The election thing was nice to have," said Seiler. "I don't know if it was our big thing, but lots of people are talking about it... it sparks conversation, which was the intent of accepting something like that. That's the intent of all the villages—to build the conversations."</p>
<p>The additional space allowed for the expansion of AvengerCon's training workshops, which included day-long classes in reverse-engineering and software "fuzzing." Additionally, the event hosted a simulation called "The Day After"—in which teams from the US Naval Academy, James Madison University, American University, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, simulated strategies for government agencies to respond to a large-scale cyberattack on the United States.</p>
<h2>More, better cyber</h2>
<p>The success of AvengerCon has prompted plans to replicate it in some form for the military and intelligence cyber community at Fort Gordon in Georgia. But the organizers also want to make sure that AvengerCon itself doesn't outgrow its grassroots, community feel. They also want it to stay focused on its mission. That fits into the overall USCYBERCOM strategy for DreamPort, which has an ongoing calendar of highly focused events surrounding the command's "Persistent Innovation" strategy.</p>
<p>"You know that cyberspace is under constant change," said Luber. "It requires us to constantly innovate, and innovation just doesn't happen in government. It's also happening in industry, academia. We need a place to work, we need a place to meet, and we need a place to innovate, and DreamPort provides that combination for us."</p>
<p>In addition to providing an environment for academic outreach to high schools and universities, Luber said DreamPort is "a mission accelerator, an incubator for US Cyber Command where projects are conducted with the goal of completing those projects within 90 days. So think of that innovation process where you've got an idea, you've got a concept, you want to run it quickly, and if you fail, you fail fast. And if you succeed, you've moved to the next step where you try and get it to operational capabilities."</p>
<p>Conducting those projects in an unclassified environment, Luber said, encourages the sharing of ideas and speeds up the creation of new solutions to cyber security issues.</p>
<h2>Rapid prototyping</h2>
<p>Some of those projects include rapid-prototyping events in which "we bring industry partners in from all different sizes, small businesses, large businesses, and then have them work the problem," Luber explained. "We've had six rapid-prototyping events over the course of the past year. We've seen even one-person companies outperform some of the bigger prime contractors that you might think that we're dealing with on a regular basis."</p>
<p>One of DreamPort's recent rapid-prototyping events was run by USCYBERCOM in partnership with the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Small Business and Manufacturing. It focused on protecting the security of small businesses within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) with the application of "zero trust" network security, which is an architectural approach to handling application and information security that would help protect their security regardless of the overall security of the network environment.</p>
<p>The project looked at ways to apply zero-trust architecture, not just to the DIB, but to Department of Defense information systems and networks as well. "By bringing together talent from DISA, NSA, USCYBERCOM, and industry, we were able to really work on some interesting prototyping activities, and it's going to help us drive the future for the Department," Luber said.</p>

<p>Back in January, Google's DeepMind team <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced that</a> its AI, dubbed AlphaStar, had beaten two top human professional players at <em>StarCraft</em>. But as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we argued at the time</a>, it wasn't quite a fair fight. Now AlphaStar has improved on its performance sufficiently to achieve Grandmaster status in <em>StarCraft II,</em> using the same interface as a human player. The team described its work in <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/alphastar/AlphaStar_unformatted.pdf">a new paper</a> in Nature.</p>
<p>"This is a dream come true," said DeepMind co-author Oriol Vinyals, who was an avid <em>StarCraft</em> player 20 years ago. "AlphaStar achieved Grandmaster level solely with a neural network and general-purpose learning algorithms—which was unimaginable ten years ago when I was researching <em>StarCraft</em> AI using rules-based systems."</p>
<p>Late last year, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/move-over-alphago-alphazero-taught-itself-to-play-three-different-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported on</a> the latest achievements of AlphaZero, a direct descendent of DeepMind's AlphaGo, which made headlines worldwide in 2016 by defeating Lee Sedol, the reigning (human) world champion in Go. AlphaGo got <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a major upgrade</a> last year, becoming capable of teaching itself winning strategies with no need for human intervention. By playing itself over and over again, AlphaZero trained itself to play Go from scratch in just three days and soundly defeated the original AlphaGo 100 games to 0. The only input it received was the basic rules of the game. Then AlphaZero <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taught itself</a> to play three different board games (chess, Go, and shogi, a Japanese form of chess) in just three days, with no human intervention.</p>
<p>The secret ingredient: "reinforcement learning," in which playing itself for millions of games allows the program to learn from experience. This works because AlphaZero is rewarded for the most useful actions (i.e., devising winning strategies). The AI does this by considering the most probable next moves and calculating the probability of winning for each of them. The most recent version combined deep reinforcement learning (many layers of neural networks) with a general-purpose Monte Carlo tree search method. As chess grandmaster <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1087" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Kasparov wrote</a> in an editorial in Science last year, "Instead of processing human instructions and knowledge at tremendous speed, as all previous chess machines, AlphaZero generates its own knowledge."</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg"><img alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar&#039;s base, showcasing robustness.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3-640x400.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg 2x" alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar&#039;s base, showcasing robustness.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar's base, showcasing robustness.</a> (credit: DeepMind)</p></div>
<p>With AlphaZero's success, DeepMind's focus shifted to a new AI frontier: games of partial (incomplete) information, like poker, and multi-player video games like <em>Starcraft II</em>. <em>StarCraft II</em> is also a game of incomplete information, and there is no single best strategy, much like playing rock-paper-scissors. It requires long-range planning ability and real-time decision-making in a large action space. Not only is the gameplay map hidden to players, but they must also control hundreds of units (mobile game pieces that can be built to influence the game) and buildings (used to create units or technologies that strengthen those units) simultaneously. As Ars' Tim Lee (an avid <em>StarCraft</em> player) <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote in January</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"<em>StarCraft</em> requires players to gather resources, build dozens of military units, and use them to try to destroy their opponents. <em>StarCraft</em> is particularly challenging for an AI because players must carry out long-term plans over several minutes of gameplay, tweaking them on the fly in the face of enemy counterattacks. DeepMind says that prior to its own effort, no one had come close to designing a <em>StarCraft</em> AI as good as the best human players."</p></blockquote>
<p>That earlier version of AlphaStar also relied on deep reinforcement learning to teach the program to mimic human strategies. At that point, the AI was proficient enough to defeat Elite-level players roughly 95% of the time. Then the DeepMind team created variants of that AI, each adopting a different playing style, and placed them into a virtual <em>StarCraft</em> league. This allowed the agents to learn from their mistakes and evolve their strategies accordingly. Then DeepMind selected the five strongest agents and pitted them against two human professional players: Dario "TLO" Wunsch and Grzegorz "MaNa" Komincz. The AI defeated its human challengers in all ten games.</p>
<p>That said, it wasn't quite a fair fight. "The ultimate way to level the playing field would be to make AlphaStar use the exact same user interface as human players," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee wrote</a> in January. "The interface could be virtualized, of course, but the game should get the same raw pixel inputs as a human player and should be required to input instructions using a sequence of mouse movements and keystrokes—with inputs limited to speeds that human hands can achieve. This is the only way to be completely sure that AlphaStar isn't giving its software an unfair advantage."</p>
<h2>Playing like a human</h2>
<p>This latest version of AlphaStar goes a long way toward addressing those issues, combining deep reinforcement learning with multi-agent learning and imitation learning directly from game data, honed once again via a virtual league. <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">Per a blog post</a> by Vinyals and fellow DeepMind co-author Wojciech Czarnecki, the new, improved AlphaStar was subject to the same constraints under which humans play, and it played on Battle.net "using the same maps and conditions as human players."</p>
<div class="image shortcode-img center large"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg"><img alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.'  src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2-640x400.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg 2x" alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.' ></a><p class="caption" style="font-size:0.8em"><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg"class="caption-link" rel="nofollow">AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.</a> (credit: DeepMind)</p></div>
<p>"The key insight of the league is that playing to win is insufficient," <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">Vinyals and Czarnecki wrote</a> of the improvements to this latest incarnation of AlphaStar. "Instead, we need both main agents whose goal is to win versus everyone, and also exploiter agents that 'take one for the team.' focusing on helping the main agent grow stronger by exposing its flaws, rather than maximizing their own win rate. Using this training method, the current league learns all its complex <em>StarCraft II</em> strategy in an end-to-end fashion—as opposed to the earlier incarnation of our work, which stitched together agents produced by a variety of methods and algorithms."</p>
<p>The AI can also now play as or against the three races in <em>Starcraft II</em>: Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. (The earlier version only played Protoss vs. Protoss.) DeepMind pitted AlphaStar against human players in a series of online games. The AI was rated at Grandmaster level for all three <em>StarCraft II</em> races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players. It's the first AI to achieve that status in a popular professional e-sport, without using a simplified version of the game. That's a strong indication that these types of general-purpose machine-learning algorithms could be used to solve complex real-world problems such as personal assistants, self-driving cars, or robotics—all of which require real-time decisions on the basis of imperfect information.</p>
<p>"At DeepMind, we're interested in understanding the potential—and limitations—of open-ended learning, which enables us to develop robust and flexible agents that can cope with complex real-world domains," Vinyals and Czarnecki <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning">wrote</a>. "Games like <em>StarCraft</em> are an excellent training ground to advance these approaches, as players must use limited information to make dynamic and difficult decisions that have ramifications on multiple levels and timescales."</p>
<p>And this time around, it appears to have been a fair fight. "I've found AlphaStar's gameplay impressive," Wunsch said of this most recent incarnation. "The system is very skilled at assessing its strategic position, and knows exactly when to engage or disengage with its opponent. And while AlphaStar has excellent and precise control, it doesn't feel superhuman—certainly not on a level that a human couldn't theoretically achieve. Overall, it feels very fair—like playing a 'real' game of <em>StarCraft</em>."</p>

<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>
<p>Bacterial blight attacks rice crops in Southeast Asia and West Africa. It is a very well-studied crop disease, and it often serves as a model system to examine the interactions between microbes and their host plants. The pathogen is called Xoo, for <em>Xanthomonas oryzae</em> pathovar <em>oryzae</em>, and it makes its living by hijacking a number of rice genes that export sugars.</p>
<p>Now, researchers have figured out how to edit the rice's genome to block this hijacking.</p>
<h2>A TALe of sugars</h2>
<p>Xoo secretes TALes (transcription activator-like effector molecules) that bind to the DNA near the rice's SWEET genes, activating them. These SWEET genes (Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporters) are ubiquitous in plants. As their name indicates, the SWEET proteins transport sucrose across the cell membrane. Their expression is required for susceptibility to Xoo.</p>
<p>Researchers thought that modifying the rice SWEET genes would confer resistance to Xoo, especially since natural-occurring resistance has arisen this way. But thus far, only a few Xoo strains have been characterized genetically, so it wasn't clear whether it had additional ways of attacking its host.</p>
<p>In order to see how to most efficiently render the rice resistant to Xoo—which of the rice's SWEET genes to change, and how—an international team of scientists first examined 63 strains of Xoo, 33 from Asia and 30 from Africa. All of them were found to use TALes to induce the expression of SWEET genes.</p>
<p>As a proof of concept, the scientists then used CRISPR to edit the DNA near three SWEET genes in Kitaake rice. This editing specifically targeted the DNA sequences that the TALe proteins stick to but left the surrounding DNA intact. It's far more specific than could be expected to occur simply by selecting for naturally occurring variants.</p>
<p>The engineered rice was resistant to all known Xoo strains. The Kitaake cultivar is a variety of <em>japonica</em> rice that is optimal for such studies since it has a quick flowering cycle and high regeneration. In the future, this new resistant line can serve as a diagnostic test to assess the virulence of any new Xoo strains that crop up.</p>
<h2>Testing on crops</h2>
<p>Since it is a variety of <em>japonica</em>, it can also be harnessed to breed the resistant trait into Japanese and Chinese rice. But it is not ideal for breeding with the <em>indica</em> varieties that are grown in most of Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>So next the team used CRISPR to modify two rice mega varieties—those grown over a million hectares. In paddy experiments, the edited rice grew normally and performed much like its unmodified parents in terms of plant height and other agriculturally relevant metrics. Critically, it was resistant to three representative strains of Xoo. Although encouraging, the researchers note that these results hardly provide a sound base for going out and planting fields of the stuff; much more extensive field trials are required, along with complete sequencing to ensure that CRISPR did not generate any off-target DNA edits.</p>
<p>Rice has over 20 SWEET genes, and only three are naturally targeted by Xoo. "Broad resistance to bacterial blight at the SWEET promoters will not prevent adaptation of the pathogen, and the durability of this approach will depend on the ability of Xoo populations to adapt to recessive resistance alleles," the authors sagely note. They suggest that making large changes in the SWEET gene promoters might delay Xoo's ability to overcome the engineered resistance.</p>

<p>Leading e-cigarette-maker Juul knowingly sold a large amount of contaminated mint-flavored e-liquid, endangering public health in the name of profits, according to a<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/BrejavsJuul.pdf"> lawsuit brought by Siddharth Breja, the company’s former senior vice president of global finance</a>.</p>
<p>Breja filed the lawsuit Tuesday, October 29 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p>
<p> Breja began working at the company in May of 2018 but alleges he was abruptly fired in March of 2019 after voicing concern that the company refused to issue a recall over the contaminated products or warn customers about the potential risk. Breja is suing Juul for retaliation for whistleblowing, wrongful termination, and other violations.</p>
<p>Overall, Breja’s complaint paints a dark picture of the company, which owns a lion’s share of the e-cigarette market in the US. The former executive claims that Juul’s senior management was motivated purely by profits and made many efforts to deceive regulators and customers, copying the despised tactics of Big Tobacco companies and trying to get customers addicted to their products.</p>
<p>Breja accuses ex-CEO Kevin Burns of managing the company like a dictator, operating in a “win-at-all-costs, reckless fashion,” and fostering a “culture of silence.”</p>
<p>When Breja raised concerns about the company selling expired or soon-to-be expired products, Burns allegedly responded: “Half our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fo’s, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.”</p>
<h2>Toxic claims</h2>
<p>Perhaps more concerning, Breja alleges that Juul sold a large amount of contaminated products out of greed. According to Breja, the company struggled to keep up with demand for mint-flavored products after Juul decided <a href="https://newsroom.juul.com/juul-labs-action-plan/">to pull other flavors from its retail stores</a> late last year. The move was meant to dodge further public backlash for the rise in teen vaping, but it resulted in supply issues that threatened profits.</p>
<p>“You need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don’t find mango they buy mint,” Burns allegedly said while berating Juul’s supply-chain team and its suppliers for the shortages.</p>
<p>In March of 2019, Breja learned that some batches of Mint eLiquid had been found to be contaminated. By that time, approximately 250,000 “Mint Refill Kits” containing the contaminated liquids had already been shipped to retailers and were being sold to customers. The contaminated kits were equivalent to one million pods, the lawsuit notes.</p>
<p>The lawsuit does not indicate what the contaminant might be. But Breja’s suit notes that the contamination issue arose “in the wake of consumers recently having reported suffering seizures due to the use of Juul’s products.”</p>
<p>In an emailed statement to Ars, a Juul spokesperson responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Breja’s claims are baseless. He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role. The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.</p></blockquote>
<p> Breja’s claims come at a critical time for Juul. The company is facing intense criticism for helping to light up an epidemic of youth vaping, particularly after revelations this summer that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/juul-gave-presentations-in-schools-to-kids-and-the-fda-is-fuming/">Juul directly pitched its products to teens while they were in school</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, the country is dealing with a rash of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/vaping-linked-lung-illness-looks-like-exposure-to-mustard-gas-doctors-say/">unexplained lung injuries that have been linked to vaping</a>. Federal and state health investigators have not been able to determine what vaping products or contaminants could be causing the illnesses, but most cases have involved black-market products containing THC (the psychoactive component of cannabis)—not nicotine products or Juul products, specifically.</p>
<p>As of October 22, 2019, there have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information">been 1,604 reported cases of vaping-related injuries</a> in 49 states, including 34 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Kevin Burns stepped down as Juul’s CEO in September. He was replaced by K. C. Crosthwaite, the former chief growth officer at Altria Group Inc., formerly Philip Morris Companies, Inc., before the appointment. On Tuesday, the company confirmed plans to lay off 500 employees by the end of the year as part of a “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-to-cut-about-500-jobs-11572301778">necessary reset</a>.”</p>
