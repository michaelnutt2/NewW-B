<p><em>Battlestar Galactica </em>is coming back. Again.</p>
<p>The reboot of the series was announced today for Comcast's upcoming NBCUniversal streaming service, Peacock, The Hollywood Reporter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/battlestar-galactica-reboot-sam-esmail-works-at-nbcus-streamer-1239018">reports today</a>.</p>
<p>The original <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> was on the air for all of one season, running from fall 1978 to spring 1979. A 2003 miniseries revisiting the core concept⁠—robots called Cylons are coming to kill us all, and that's Very Bad⁠—served as the backdoor pilot to an eventual four-season run on the SyFy basic cable network (then called Sci Fi). The reboot series, which ran from 2004 to 2008, proved divisive among fans, inspiring passionate responses to both undeniably strong and extremely questionable writing choices throughout its run.</p>
<p>The new show will be "an updated, more modern look at the world" based on the 2004 edition, THR says, not the 1978 original. The show will be helmed by Sam Esmail, who is best known as the creator of <em>Mr. Robot</em>. The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/fa-la-la-la-lan-elliot-has-a-naughty-list-for-mr-robots-final-season/">final season</a> of <em>Mr. Robot</em> will be airing this fall, freeing Esmail up for other projects. He will reportedly also be heading up two other series for the streaming service, including an adaptation of the classic 1927 film <em><a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-metropolis-1927">Metropolis</a></em>.</p>
<p>In a tweet posted after this story was originally written, Esmail <a href="https://twitter.com/samesmail/status/1173987378894999552">clarified</a> that the show is not a straight remake but instead something of a spinoff, "because... why mess with perfection? Instead, we’ll explore a new story within the mythology while staying true to the spirit of Battlestar. So say we all!"</p>
<p>You may now feel free to relitigate the pros and cons of the 2004 series in the comments. (The cast was perfect. Fight me.)</p>
