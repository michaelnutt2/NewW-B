<p>Netflix and Sony Pictures Television <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1173634552373243912">confirmed</a> on Monday that they had reached a streaming-exclusivity deal for one of the most popular TV series in the world: <em>Seinfeld</em>.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2021, Netflix will become the exclusive online-streaming home for the series throughout the world. This will bump current online distributors Hulu (USA) and Amazon (most other streamed regions). Hulu's previous five-year deal for the series' domestic streaming rights to the series was pegged at anywhere between <a href="https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/hulu-seinfeld-licensing-160-million-1201483537/">$160M</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/29/hulu-scores-streaming-rights-to-seinfeld-signs-amc-deal/">$180M</a> per year. This new Netflix's deal likely adds up to more money based solely on its international reach, but neither Sony, Netflix, or Castle Rock Entertainment disclosed any terms.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2019-09-16/netflix-acquires-the-global-streaming-rights-to-seinfeld">The LA Times reported</a> that Netflix has announced full 4K resolution support for Seinfeld's Netflix run, a first for the series. It remains to be seen how this upscaling will be handledâ€”whether to expect the original, grain-filled video being recreated like on some of the finest UHD Blu-rays on the market or if we will see significant digital touch-ups instead. (Either way, we wonder whether Kramer will apply his ingenuity to this 4K-ization, akin to his work on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A-dVa734i4">tie dispensers</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8YIbhJhH7s">male lingerie</a>.)</p>
<p>The same report also alleges that Netflix outbid a huge field of streaming competitors for Seinfeld's global streaming rights: NBCUniversal, CBS All Access, AT&amp;T TimeWarner, Hulu, and Amazon. Notably missing from that list: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/apple-tv-subscription-service-soft-launches-november-1-for-4-99mo/">Apple TV+</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/disney-espn-hulu-bundle-will-land-in-november-for-12-99month/">Disney+</a>, who each have their own paths paved for November 2019 service launches.</p>
<p>The news comes as Netflix faces stiffer competition in the nostalgic-TV sector. AT&amp;T Time Warner is pushing full steam ahead with its HBO Max product in 2020, and the service made headlines in July when it announced that the '90s sitcom <em>Friends</em>, which currently streams on Netflix, would <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/att-starts-restricting-time-warner-shows-to-its-own-streaming-service/">jump ship to HBO Max upon its launch</a>. This was followed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/hbo-max-secures-exclusive-usa-streaming-rights-for-dr-who-other-bbc-series/">August's massive HBO Max deal struck with BBC America</a> to exclusively carry series like Dr. Who, Luther, and Top Gear.</p>
