Once in place, Messagetap monitors the network for messages containing either a preset list of phone or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity\">IMSI</a> numbers or a preset list of keywords.</p>\n<p>Messages that meet the criteria are then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or\">XOR</a> encoded and saved for harvesting later. FireEye said it found the malware infecting an undisclosed telecom provider. The company researchers said the malware is loaded by an installation script but didn\u2019t otherwise explain how infections take place.</p>\n<h2>Targeting upstream data sources</h2>\n<p>The security firm said Messagetap belongs to APT41, one of several advanced persistent threat hacking groups that researchers say is sponsored by the Chinese government. The group is apparently using the malware to spy on high-ranking military and government officials. In a <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/messagetap-who-is-reading-your-text-messages.html\">report</a>, the researchers said the malware allows China\u2019s intelligence services to obtain a wide range of sensitive data at scale.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe use of MESSAGETAP and targeting of sensitive text messages and call detail records at scale is representative of the evolving nature of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns observed by FireEye,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cAPT41 and multiple other threat groups attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors have increased their targeting of upstream data entities since 2017. These organizations, located multiple layers above end-users, occupy critical information junctures in which data from multitudes of sources converge into single or concentrated nodes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Messagetap\u2019s 64-bit Linux executable contains two configuration files. The first,\u00a0<code>parm.txt</code>, contains lists of IMSI numbers and phone numbers of interest while <code>keyword_parm.txt</code> lists keywords. Both files are deleted from disk once loaded into memory. After that, Messagetap monitors all traffic passing over the network and looks for messages that match the criteria from the configuration text files. Messages sent to or from the phone or IMSI numbers are collected. Messages containing the keywords are also gathered. The malware parses all traffic at the Ethernet and IP layers and continues parsing protocol layers including SCTP, SCCP, and TCAP.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png\"><img alt='An overview of Messagetap.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview-640x398.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png 2x\" alt='An overview of Messagetap.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">An overview of Messagetap.</a> (credit: FireEye)</p></div>\n<p>Researchers recovered the contents of the configuration files and found a \u201chigh volume of phone numbers and IMSI numbers.\u201d Thursday\u2019s report continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The inclusion of both phone and IMSI numbers show the highly targeted nature of this cyber intrusion. If an SMS message contained either a phone number or an IMSI number that matched the predefined list, it was saved to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor. The targeted phone numbers and IMSI numbers belonged to foreign high-ranking individuals of interest to the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the keyword list contained items of geopolitical interest for Chinese intelligence collection. Sanitized examples include the names of political leaders, military and intelligence organizations and political movements at odds with the Chinese government. If any SMS messages contained these keywords, MESSAGETAP would save the SMS message to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor.</p>\n<p>In addition to MESSAGETAP SMS theft, Mandiant also identified the threat actor interacting with call detail record (CDR) databases to query, save and steal records for specific individuals during this same intrusion. Targeting CDR information provides a high-level overview of phone calls between individuals, including time, duration, and phone numbers. In contrast, MESSAGETAP captures the contents of specific text messages.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Messagetap isn\u2019t likely to have monitored the vast majority of the infected telecom\u2019s users, its existence shows that network providers aren\u2019t the only entities that can tap phone networks. Its use demonstrates the prudence of not using phone networks to relay sensitive information unencrypted. The <a href=\"https://signal.org/download/\">Signal</a> messenger remains the best way to send encrypted texts between two phones.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594265&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

Currently, all 10nm parts are produced in two of the company's plants: Hillsboro, Oregon, and Kiryat Gat, Israel. But beginning next quarter, Intel's fabrication facility in Chandler, Arizona, will also be producing 10nm parts.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields.png\"><img alt='Intel claims 10nm yields are &quot;ahead of expectations&quot; even before bringing the 10nm fab in Arizona online.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields-640x362.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields-1280x724.png 2x\" alt='Intel claims 10nm yields are &quot;ahead of expectations&quot; even before bringing the 10nm fab in Arizona online.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/q3-priorities-yields.png\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intel claims 10nm yields are \"ahead of expectations\" even before bringing the 10nm fab in Arizona online.</a> (credit: Intel Corporation)</p></div>\n<p>What we find more interesting than the 10nm recovery is that Intel still seems to be very serious about pivoting away from being a CPU company. Since 1991, the iconic \"Intel Inside\" logo has referred to the CPU in your computer, but the company sees more potential in investments in storage, software, networking, AI, and the data center.</p>\n<p>This certainly doesn't mean Intel plans to exit the consumer and server CPU business, but it does herald a large shift in the company's overall focus. The company estimates the TAM\u2014Total Addressable Market, or the maximum revenue if literally every potential customer bought an Intel product\u2014of its traditional PC and server CPU line at $52 billion. However, it sees an additional $220 billion TAM potential in what it calls \"Data-centric\" products in data center, Internet of Things, and networking market segments.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/redefining-intel-inside-980x555.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Intel wants to shift much of its focus away from the CPU and onto what it's dubbing the \"XPU\"\u2014a term it's pushing which includes GPUs, FPGAs, and other more specialized processors.

The slide that really drives this commitment home comes from Q2's investor meeting that explicitly shows the company moving from a \"protect and defend\" strategy to a growth strategy. If this slide were in a sales meeting, it wouldn't say much\u2014but delivered to the company's investors, it gains a bit of gravitas.</p>\n<p>Most of this was revealed nearly six months ago at the company's May 2019 investor's meeting, but the Q3 investor's meeting last week continues with and strengthens this story for Intel's future growth, with slides more focused on Optane, network, and IoT/Edge market growth than with the traditional PC and server market.</p>\n<p>The company shows its new \"data-centric\" market as having already caught up with its traditional PC-centric market, with almost 50% of its Q3 revenue derived from data-centric products. The majority of the operating income (roughly speaking, profit) returns from those products is outpacing the traditional market as well.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/other-data-centric-revenue-q3-980x555.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          \"Other data-centric business segments\" refers in part to the company's Mobileye driver-assist and semi-autonomous vehicle business, as well as Optane and network gear.

The company does still want to talk about CPUs, but there's an increasing pressure for coverage of its AI, networking, and even software efforts as the company shifts footing. We believe that this change in focus is likely a good one for consumers, assuming Intel finds the market growth it's looking for in new segments. With higher growth and margins in newer ventures, consumers can hope that Intel will make good on its stated intent to relax its protectionist stance in the CPU market along the way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594075&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

Total revenue was $64 billion.</p>\n<p>Apple revealed during the proceedings that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/iphone-11-review-the-sweet-spot-iphone/\">iPhone 11</a> (sans <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-and-11-pro-max-review-high-quality-for-high-prices/\">Pro</a>) is now its best-selling phone, and that iPhone revenue was $33 billion\u2014a 9% decline over the same quarter the previous fiscal year, albeit an improvement over the 15% decline the company saw in the previous three quarters this year. (That improvement is very likely accounted for by the launch of the iPhone 11 and its ilk mid-September, just before the quarter ended.)</p>\n<p>Mac sales were down 5%, but Apple CEO Tim Cook was quick to point out on the earnings call with investors that the company released a major update to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/apple-updates-entry-level-macbook-air-and-pro-discontinues-macbook/\">MacBook Air</a>, one of its most popular computers, around this time last year but has not done so yet this year, ostensibly explaining some of the drop.</p>\n<p>Apple is expected to refresh some of its laptops in the coming months and plans to imminently launch the pricy <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/our-first-look-photos-of-the-apples-new-mac-pro-and-the-pro-display-xdr/\">Mac Pro</a>. Aimed at creative professionals, the Mac Pro's price point makes it less of a mass-market device than the MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>Apple boasted 18% growth in services revenue, an improvement over the previous quarter that brings the 2019 fiscal year total to $46 billion. It was $12.5 billion for this quarter on its own. Among other things, this was credited to \"all-time record revenues from payment services\" like Apple Pay. The company alluded to the recent launches of Apple Card, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade, but it did not provide individual numbers for them during the call. Apple also said today that this was the best quarter ever for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The iPad saw 17% growth driven by the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/2018-ipad-pro-review-whats-a-computer/\">iPad Pro</a>, but the big positive narrative from the company was that of wearables, which include Apple Watch and AirPods. The company saw 54% growth in that category, and the quarter in question ended before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> were announced or released.</p>\n<p>In an answer to an investor question, Cook let it be known that he sees wearables like the Watch and its associated health functionality as the future of the company. \"There will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Some investors are understandably concerned that many of Apple's growth areas are dependent on the iPhone. Users are sticking with their existing iPhones and opting going longer between upgrades than ever before, leading to ever-slowing iPhone sales. But Apple stock <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2019.html\">rose</a> slightly after the call regardless, indicating that the market at least believes Apple still has plenty of room to grow in services and wearables in the near term before the iPhone's slowing momentum becomes a serious problem.</p>\n<p>And in some cases, the numbers bear that out: a substantial portion of Apple's wearables revenue (which now stands toe-to-toe with the Mac) comes from customers making a first-time purchase in that category. And Cook again made vague allusions to major new products in the wearables category, which (not his words) could include the company's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-headset-with-a-new-os-report-says/\">rumored augmented reality headset</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite those declining iPhone sales, Apple users probably shouldn't be too concerned about the future of the ecosystem they've invested in. The company stated earlier this year that it has an install base of 900 million iPhones globally. Whether that continues to grow is a concern for investors looking for big returns in their portfolios, but not for users; an install base that size all but ensures continued support, content, and updates for many years yet.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Q1 2020, Apple projects revenue between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion\u2014Q1 is often a big quarter for the company, as it carries holiday sales and much of the immediate post-launch revenue from the new iPhone lineup.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594215&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

And they're not telling tall tales. The lenses can cause infections, sores, scratches, vision-impairing scars, and even blindness. It\u2019s easy to find eye-related horror stories from people who turned to black-market lenses to change the color, shape, or look of their eyes (some lenses even <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/7831901/Famous-and-infamous-sports-marketing-stunts.html?image=2\">add logos</a> to your eyeballs).</p>\n<p>Just on Tuesday, USA Today reported the case of a Cleveland woman who got decorative lenses <a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/woman-goes-er-remove-contact-lenses-stuck-eye-t165627\">stuck to her eyeballs</a>. The lenses were supposed to turn her brown eyes blue but instead made them swollen and red. She had to have them removed in an emergency room.</p>\n<p>Still, decorative lenses have proven incredibly popular. The color-contact-lens market has at times been valued at $300 million, accounting for 15% of the total market for contact lenses.</p>\n<p>People tend to pick them up from street vendors, beauty salons, flea markets, and novelty shops. But selling them over the counter is actually illegal. Contact lenses are considered a medical device and are regulated as such by the Food and Drug Administration. Anyone buying them needs to have a prescription for the lenses.</p>\n<p>The dodgy, black-market lenses often turn out be contaminated, irritating, or simply the wrong size for your eyeball, causing injuries. If they\u2019re too small for your eye or don\u2019t allow enough air through, the lenses can cut off oxygen to the cornea\u2014the clear surface of the eye. This corneal hypoxia can allow infections to fester as well as cause damage the corneal tissue.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s just one of many potential problems. Things get even more dicey when people fail to follow basic contact-care instructions\u2014like cleaning them occasionally and not sleeping with them or sharing them (which can spread infections).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=16163010\">a 2005 medical report</a>, a team of eye doctors laid out 12 consecutive cases of people arriving in medical centers with severe eye problems after using decorative lenses. The cases range from mild to extreme.</p>\n<h2>Shiver me timbers</h2>\n<p>Patient 1 was a 16-year-old girl who showed up with eye pain and redness after wearing a colored lens. She admitted to sleeping with the lenses as well as sharing them with her younger brother. Doctors treated her with artificial tears and an antibiotic ointment, and her symptoms quickly improved.</p>\n<p>Patient 12, on the other hand, was not so lucky. After buying cat-eye lenses at a flea market, the 26-year-old man developed a severe, painful infection called <em>Acanthamoeba</em> keratitis. The infection is caused by a free-living amoeba running rampant in the cornea, which can be blinding\u2014as it was in this case. \u00a0He ended up needing a corneal transplant, and three months afterwards his vision was still 20/200, which is considered legally blind.</p>\n<p>Patient 11 also suffered permanent vision loss. The 39-year-old woman went to the doctor with pain, redness, and blurred vision in her left eye after buying colored lenses at a hair salon. Her ophthalmologist quickly spotted an ulcer in the center of her cornea, which was positive for the pathogenic bacteria <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. She was admitted to the hospital for intensive antibiotic therapy. But two months later, her best corrected vision in the affected eye was only 20/50.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-4.23.05-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Patient 9, a 16-year-old girl who bought colored lenses at a flea market, had a central corneal ulcer positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.

While Patient 11 told doctors that she regularly cleaned her black-market lenses, Patient 2\u2014a 16-year-old girl\u2014kept hers in dirty cases with obvious debris and continued to use them after doctors told her to stop.</p>\n<p>When doctors analyzed the lenses, they found multiple bacteria normally found in the intestines (and feces) including <em>Klebsiella</em> species, <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</em> Two lenses also contained acanthamoeba\u2014the amoeba that caused Patient 12\u2019s blindness. One lens was positive for a fungal <em>Fusarium</em> species. The lens solutions and cases were positive for bacteria <em>Serratia marcescens</em>, <em>Serratia fonticola</em>, and <em>Klebsiella</em> species.</p>\n<p>Patient 2 was seen multiple times for persistent infection and irritation but stopped going to appointments after six weeks.</p>\n<p>Such poor hygiene and care practices can cause eye infections and damage with any type of contact lens. But doing so with sketchy fashion lenses is particularly dangerous.</p>\n<p>If you really want to change the look of your eye, the FDA emphasizes that it\u2019s very important to buy <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/contact-lenses/list-contact-lenses\">FDA-approved decorative lenses</a> through your eye doctor or another reputable vendor\u2014with your prescription.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594115&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

(credit: Getty Images)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/while-one-texas-county-shook-off-ransomware-small-cities-took-full-punch/\">more than 20 local governments in Texas</a> were hit this summer by ransomware in one day. The attack was apparently tracked back to one thing the organizations had in common: a managed service provider. With limited IT resources of their own, local governments have increasingly turned to MSPs to operate significant portions of their networks and applications, as have other organizations and businesses\u2014often placing critical parts of their business operations in the MSPs' hands. And that has made MSPs a very attractive target to ransomware operators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.armor.com/reports/new-msps-%20compromised-reports-armor\">Threat researchers at the global cloud security provider Armor</a> have been tracking publicly-reported incidents in which MSP and cloud service providers have been hit with ransomware. Thus far, they have documented 13 such incidents this year\u2014with 6 of them reported in the past few months.</p>\n<p>The most recent publicly exposed victim is Billtrust, which as<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/10/ransomware-hits-b2b-payments-firm-billtrust/\"> security journalist Brian Krebs reported,</a> was hit by <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/billing-provider-billtrust-suffers-outage-after-malware-attack/\">what BleepingComputer reported was BitPaymer ransomware</a> (a report that has not been confirmed). BillTrust is an online invoicing and billing provider based in New Jersey that also provides credit decision services. Billtrust executives sent an email to customers on October 22, informing them of the attack, stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our standard security and back-up procedures have been and remain instrumental in our ability to execute the ongoing restoration of services... Out of an abundance of caution, we cannot disclose the precise ransomware strains but will do so as soon as prudently possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other victims include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SchoolinSites, a cloud-based service provider for school districts that offered websites and parental access to student information, <a href=\"https://www.wkrg.com/news/mcpss-website-hacked-by-virus/\">was taken down in an attack in September</a> as reported by WKRG in Mobile, Alabama. The company's email was affected as well as other communications; SchoolinSites had to use Facebook to provide updates during the outage, which began on September 23.</li>\n<li>TrialWorks, a Florida-based case management software provider, was <a href=\"https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2019/10/ransomware-attack-reportedly-hits-practice-management-company-locking-lawyers-out-of-their-case-files.html\">hit by a ransomware attack the week of October 14.</a> The company, which serves about 2,500 law firms, acknowledged the ransomware attack and said that, while it did not impact their software, about 5% of the company's customers could not access their accounts.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2019/06/13/calif-mls-giant-temporarily-shuts-down-after-malware-attack\">California-based MetroList,</a> a real estate multiple listing and application services firm with about 20,000 real estate broker customers, was hit by ransomware in June, taking the company's services offline for two days. MetroList reportedly paid the ransom, which included a $10,000 insurance deductible.</li>\n<li>Also on October 14, <a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/ascension/article_b6194b7a-eba2-11e9-a388-5b6eedc7c596.html\">Magnolia Pediatrics of Prairieville, Louisiana</a>, was reportedly hit by ransomware via the practice's managed IT services provider. Magnolia reported the ransomware to law enforcement.</li>\n<li>In July, CorVel, a managed service provider for insurance companies handling workers compensation, auto, health, and disability claims, <a href=\"https://www.joepaduda.com/2019/07/26/corvels-problem-may-be-ransomware/\">got hit by Ryuk ransomware</a>. As the company responded, systems used to process claims, email and phone systems, and healthcare provider databases were taken offline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations using full-service IT-managed service providers, such as Magnolia Pediatrics, are particularly at risk because the security of all of their systems is dependent on that of the MSP. As was the case in Texas, this meant that all their data was put at risk. In Magnolia's case, all patient data was encrypted, but it could just as easily have been stolen by attackers\u2014and since that data includes personal identifying data for children, it could have significant long-term consequences. A clinic spokesperson said that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Magnolia advised patients' families to monitor credit card statements and credit bureau reports.</p>\n<p>These issues are why having a conversation (and a contract) with a service provider that includes security is so important.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594073&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

That's because they won't be allowed to pay for political advertising.</p>\n<p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has apparently taken a look at the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/no-you-apparently-cant-run-for-office-just-to-put-false-ads-on-facebook/\">controversy</a> currently embroiling Facebook and decided he wants no part of it.</p>\n<p>\"We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally,\" Dorsey announced in, naturally, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1189634377057067008\">a tweet</a>. </p>\n<p>He framed the choice as an opportunity for anyone with a message, rather than a penalty, adding, \"A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\"</p>\n<p>The ban applies not only to candidates and their campaigns but also to \"issue ads\" by any group, Dorsey continued, since those \"present a way to circumvent\" the ban on political advertising and would present a situation where \"everyone but candidates\" could pay to have their view on an issue promoted. He also added an apparent dig at Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For instance, it's not credible for us to say: \"We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad... well...they can say whatever they want! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude09\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"This isn't about free expression,\" Dorsey went on. \"This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address.\"</p>\n<h2>Direct challenge</h2>\n<p>The stance comes in direct opposition to social media leader Facebook, which explicitly exempts both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/facebook-confirms-its-standards-dont-apply-to-politicians/\">posts</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/political-ads-can-lie-if-they-want-facebook-confirms/\">advertisements</a> made by politicians from its community standards and fact-checking process. </p>\n<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly doubled down on his company's position amid a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers, political candidates, and even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebooks-new-political-ad-policy-already-showing-cracks-loopholes/\">employees</a>. In a congressional hearing last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) directly challenged Zuckerberg on the company's policy.</p>\n<p>\"Do you see a potential problem here with the complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked.</p>\n<p>\"Well, congresswoman, I think lying is bad,\" Zuckerberg replied. \"I think if you're gonna lie, that would be bad.\" But that would be different from preventing people from \"seeing that you had lied,\" he tried to explain.</p>\n<p>\"So you will take down lies, or you won't take down lies? I think this is a pretty simple yes or no,\" she pressed.</p>\n<p>\"In a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote down are saying,\" he answered. Any actions Facebook might take \"depends on the context\" in which a dishonest piece of content is posted, he added.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594105&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

Apple's habit of late has been to release most of its operating system updates for each platform all on the same day. But in this instance, though, macOS and watchOS came a single day after iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS updates.</p>\n<p>The macOS update mainly adds features we already saw yesterday in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-and-ipados-13-2/\">iOS and iPadOS 13.2</a>. That includes support for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, the ability to opt in or out of sharing Siri recordings with Apple, new emoji, and new HomeKit feature support. There are also a number of macOS-specific bug fixes and the restoration of some lost Photos features.</p>\n<p>Here are Apple's update notes for macOS Catalina 10.15.1:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The macOS Catalina 10.15.1 update includes updated and additional emoji, support for AirPods Pro, HomeKit Secure Video, HomeKit enabled routers, and new Siri privacy settings, as well as bug fixes and improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Emoji</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 70 new or updated emoji, including animals, food, activities, new accessibility emoji, gender-neutral emoji, and skin tones selection for couple emoji</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AirPods</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduces support for AirPods Pro</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Home app</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HomeKit Secure Video enables you to privately capture, store, and view encrypted video from your security cameras and features people, animal, and vehicle detection</li>\n<li>HomeKit-enabled routers let you control how your HomeKit accessories communicate over the Internet or in your home</li>\n<li>Adds support for AirPlay 2-enabled speakers in scenes and automations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Siri</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy settings to control whether or not to help improve Siri and Dictation by allowing Apple to store audio of your Siri and Dictation interactions</li>\n<li>Option to delete your Siri and Dictation history from Siri Settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This update also includes the following bug fixes and improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restores the ability to view file names in the All Photos view in Photos</li>\n<li>Restores the ability to filter by favorites, photos, videos, edited, and keywords in Days view in Photos</li>\n<li>Fixes an issue where Messages would only send a single notification when the option to repeat alerts was enabled</li>\n<li>Resolves an issue that caused Contacts to launch to the previously opened contact instead of the contact list</li>\n<li>Adds a two-finger swipe gesture for back navigation in Apple News</li>\n<li>Resolves issues that may occur in the Music app when displaying playlists inside folders and newly added songs in the Songs list</li>\n<li>Improves reliability of migrating iTunes library databases into the Music, Podcasts, and TV apps</li>\n<li>Fixes an issue where downloaded titles were not visible in the Downloads folder in the TV app</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>watchOS 6.1 is a very small update; its main purpose appears to be AirPods Pro support; users can now manage their active-noise-cancelation settings via the Watch for the new earphones. Additionally, Apple has brought watchOS 6 to the series 1 and series 2 Apple Watch devices as previously promised. (They were not supported by the first release of watchOS 6.)</p>\n<p>Here are Apple's brief watchOS 6.1 update notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>watchOS 6.1 introduces support for \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c and includes improvements and bug fixes. This update also brings \u200cwatchOS 6\u200c to \u200cApple Watch\u200c Series 1 and Series 2.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, Apple released a security update labeled watchOS 5.3.3 for Apple Watches not running watchOS 6. This is necessary even though watchOS 6 supports all Watch models now because watchOS 6 only works with iPhones that can run iOS 13, but some users are on older handsets.</p>\n<p>Both updates should be available to all users today.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593945&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

But there are ways to study personality empirically\u2014they just involve accepting a lot of imperfection and fuzziness.</p>\n<p>The \"Big Five\" personality traits do seem to get at something meaningful about human personality. They certainly don't capture everything, but Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism are traits that can be measured with a high degree of stability from one test to the next. They change in predictable ways across people's lifespans and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/meta-analysis-shows-psychotherapy-leads-to-long-term-personality-change/\">with therapy</a>, and they seem to be related in measurable ways to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/programmers-are-a-tiny-bit-introverted-but-otherwise-agreeable/\">people's lives</a> outside the context of a personality test.</p>\n<p>One of those traits\u2014conscientiousness\u2014is, unsurprisingly, strongly related to how people perform at work. But why, and in what settings? A paper published this week in PNAS used the data from more than 2,500 studies to summarize what we know about conscientiousness. Unexpectedly, the authors find that conscientiousness scores make less of a difference to people's performance when they're in high-complexity careers. Instead, they mainly seems to matter in low- or moderate-complexity jobs.</p>\n<h2>More than just being neat</h2>\n<p>Human personality is, obviously, an incredibly tricky thing to measure. People's personalities are somewhat stable from one week or month to the next, but how they're feeling on the day of the test will obviously change their answers to an extent. And the phenomenon of personality itself is obviously incredibly complex.</p>\n<p>So a Big Five personality test doesn't try to carve people into distinct categories\u2014either an extrovert or an introvert, agreeable or not. Instead, it places people on a sliding scale relative to other people on each of the five traits. You could be in the top 30% of extraverted people but still know people more extraverted than you.</p>\n<p>Each trait breaks down into different facets that try to capture different components of it. The questions used to assess conscientiousness tap into a combination of someone's orderliness, cautiousness, self-discipline, dutifulness, achievement-striving, and a facet called \"self-efficacy\" (which is related to behaviors like finishing tasks properly). Together, these facets all get at slightly different angles of what it means to be \"conscientious.\"</p>\n<p>The Big Five traits offer a way of capturing people's personalities that is obviously imperfect, but\u00a0 they still have a meaningful connection with how people behave in the real world. If you take a group of 1,000 people and test their conscientiousness and then their job performance, you'll find that higher conscientiousness and higher job performance go hand in hand. If you then randomly pull one very conscientious person out of the 1,000, there's a reasonably good chance (but no certainty!) that they'll do well at a job.</p>\n<p>Measuring conscientiousness is obviously handy for employers trying to figure out who to employ. To cut through the variability inherent in individual studies, researchers Michael Wilmot and Deniz Ones threw together a huge amount of data from hundreds of studies to get a more precise estimate on how and why conscientiousness matters.</p>\n<h2>Creatures of habit</h2>\n<p>Wilmot and Ones went a step beyond using a meta-analysis and performed a meta-meta-analysis. They used 92 meta-analyses, which pulled data from more than 2,500 studies and more than a million participants. This should provide an unusually precise estimate of just how much conscientiousness matters.</p>\n<p>Results from the huge dataset showed that conscientiousness was strongly related to positive work behaviors. For instance, people high in conscientiousness were good at setting goals and avoiding procrastination. They were less aggressive and less irresponsible than people with low conscientiousness.</p>\n<p>But there were some results that won't sound quite so obvious. For instance, conscientiousness is related to conformity and security, so a \"preference for more predictable environments\" was a strong theme in the results, the researchers write.</p>\n<p>Perhaps because of this, conscientiousness seemed to make more of a difference in some careers than others. In jobs that were high in complexity, it didn't make much of a difference at all. Meanwhile, in jobs that were moderate in complexity, like customer service and sales, conscientiousness made a much bigger difference.</p>\n<p>The researchers suggest that high-complexity jobs, which require creative problem solving, aren't necessarily a great match for highly conscientious people who want structure and predictability in their work. But it might also be that complex jobs tend to attract conscientious people, and so everyone in those professions is already pretty high in conscientiousness, with less difference among them. Another possibility is that there are jobs where high conscientiousness is a minimum threshold for making it in and just one of a suite of traits that are necessary for doing well, says\u00a0Marcus Cred\u00e9, who researches conscientiousness but wasn't involved in the paper.</p>\n<h2>Personality change</h2>\n<p>The paper does a great job of pulling together a mountain of evidence on what researchers have suspected about conscientiousness, says Cred\u00e9, but there are some caveats. The research itself isn't weak, but measuring people's personalities is just incredibly tricky. If you test someone's conscientiousness while they're filling in a job application, they're obviously going to presenting themselves in a certain way\u2014so their answers will reflect not just their actual conscientiousness, but also their awareness of what an employer will be looking for.</p>\n<p>Wilmot and Ones suggest that it would be a good idea to try improving conscientiousness in schoolkids. Cred\u00e9, though, isn't so sure. Conscientiousness does tend to increase with age, but changing it intentionally is a different matter. \"I'm not aware of any particularly successful intervention program,\" he says.</p>\n<p>It's possible that some of the facets of conscientiousness could respond to training, he adds\u2014safety training, for instance, could possibly increase people's cautiousness. But \"getting someone to be more achievement-striving? It'd be lovely if you could! You could make a lot of money if you could figure that out.\"</p>\n<p><em>You can take a Big Five test <a href=\"http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>PNAS, 2018.

That policy frees up holders of political jobs, and candidates seeking those jobs, to, basically, lie their entire faces off in Facebook ads if they choose to do so.</p>\n<p>The Internet and the 21st century being what they are, of course, many people greeted this news with responses along the lines of: \"Does that mean I can just sign up for any local race and then put any ads I want on Facebook?\" One man decided to find out. And so far, at least, the answer seems to be: No. </p>\n<p>Adriel Hampton lives in California and runs a digital marketing firm that promotes progressive causes. On Monday, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/facebook-false-ads-california-governor/index.html\">formally registered</a> as a candidate for the state's gubernatorial race, and his <a href=\"https://civichall.org/civicist/op-ed-its-time-to-challenge-techs-power-at-the-ballot-box/\">stated platform</a> explicitly challenges both President Donald Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>His plan, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/facebook-false-ads-california-governor/index.html\">told CNN</a>, was to use his new status as a political candidate to buy ads on Facebook promoting false content about Trump, Zuckerberg, and others explicitly to call attention to Facebook's policies and force the company to change them.</p>\n<h2>Who\u2019s a politician?</h2>\n<p>Hampton's bid to become the Golden State's next head honcho isn't his first foray into challenging Facebook's ad policies. In fact, it's not even his first headline-grabbing Facebook-related action in the last week.</p>\n<p>Hampton also runs a political action committee, The Really Online Lefty League (TROLL), which a few days ago lived up to its name by purchasing a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook/facebook-takes-down-false-ad-from-pac-on-republican-graham-idUSKBN1X50IZ\">stunt advertisement</a> claiming Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) supports the Green New Deal, a progressive policy package and the signature proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y). </p>\n<p>Graham, who is a devoted Republican, is as ardent an opponent of the Green New Deal as you might expect and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/28/blog-posting/no-lindsey-graham-does-not-support-green-new-deal/\">has said</a>: \"There's not one Republican going to vote for anything coming out of the Green New Deal 'cause it\u2019s crazy.\"</p>\n<p>Facebook suspended the ad's paid distribution. It said that\u2014because the promotion came from a third-party PAC rather than directly from a candidate or politician\u2014it was eligible for review and removal under the site's policy.</p>\n<p>Launching a campaign doesn't appear to be enough to make Hampton a legitimately exempt advertiser in Facebook's eyes, though. Facebook <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/tech/facebook-california-candidate-false-ads/index.html\">told CNN</a>, \"This person has made clear he registered as a candidate to get around our policies, so his content, including ads, will continue to be eligible for third-party fact-checking.\"</p>\n<p>Hampton responded to CNN that Facebook, \"made a policy specific to me, and I am running for California governor to regulate Facebook,\" adding, \"I am going to look at suing them\u2014I will immediately seek all available legal options.\"</p>\n<h2>Beyond stunts</h2>\n<p>The fight around what Facebook does or does not allow on its site is already beyond exhausting\u2014but it's almost certainly going to get worse before (or if) it manages to get better. US politicians on all sides are wading into the fray, and with the 2020 election <em>almost</em> finally less than a year away, tensions are only going to intensify.</p>\n<p>The current fight over political ads on Facebook began when President Donald Trump's re-election campaign <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/political-ads-can-lie-if-they-want-facebook-confirms/\">ran a false ad</a> about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is among the leading candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The site refused to pull the spot, kicking off outrage, especially from Biden's fellow Democrats.</p>\n<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another leading contender in the crowded 2020 field, herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1183019880867680256?lang=en\">launched a false ad</a> on Facebook earlier this month to draw attention to what she sees as the platform's failings. \"Breaking news,\" the ad begins: \"Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.\"</p>\n<p>It immediately reveals the deception as it goes on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \"how could this possibly be true?\"</p>\n<p>Well, it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is give Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform\u2014and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook inexplicably used its official news twitter account to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1183162508846215168\">challenge Warren</a>, comparing itself to legacy TV broadcasters, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Facebook, however, is not subject to regulation by the FCC\u2014nor would company leadership particularly want it to be, one assumes.</p>\n<p>\"You're making my point here,\" Warren responded. \"It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards.\"</p>\n<p>Investigations by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/28/pro-trump-super-pacs-draw-scrutiny-facebook-ads-seeking-voter-registration-data/\">The Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-latinos-analysis/vamos-to-victory-trumps-spanish-ads-skirt-immigration-warn-of-socialism-idUSKBN1X913E\">Reuters</a>, and others, meanwhile, show that questionable political advertising by third parties is not only rampant, but also can stay up on Facebook until media attention causes the company to pull it down.</p>\n<p>Employees, meanwhile, are reportedly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebooks-new-political-ad-policy-already-showing-cracks-loopholes/\">no happier with the contentious policy than anyone else</a>: more than 250 Facebook workers have signed onto an open letter asking the company to adopt new standards for political ads.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593859&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

A year ago, <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2018/4q-2018/4Q18%20Earnings%20Release.pdf\">AT&amp;T said</a> it would spend $23 billion on gross capital investment in 2019. (These numbers include network construction and vendor-financing payments but do not include some spending on AT&amp;T's FirstNet public safety network, which is reimbursed by the federal government.)</p>\n<p>The company is on pace to exceed its 2019 goal as it averaged <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/3Q19_Trending%20Schedules.pdf\">more than $6 billion per quarter</a> in the first three quarters. But with a forecast of $20 billion across all of 2020, AT&amp;T expects to spend about $5 billion per quarter on capital investments going forward. The company is under pressure from investors to control spending, in part because its TV business is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/att-loses-another-1-3-million-tv-customers-as-directv-freefall-continues/\">tanking</a> and because of AT&amp;T's giant debt load stemming from the purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T increased capital investment between 2018 and 2019, but its 2020 outlook would push the company's spending to lower than its 2018 total of $21.8 billion. AT&amp;T, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/att-promised-7000-new-jobs-to-get-tax-break-it-cut-23000-jobs-instead/\">as you might remember</a>, promised increased capital spending and thousands of new jobs in exchange for a corporate tax cut and <a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/108302543725436/AT%26T%20reply%20comments%2017-108.pdf\">claimed</a> that the now-repealed federal net neutrality rules harmed broadband-network investment.\u00a0The tax cut alone\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-sees-big-benefit-from-tax-law-1517434789\">reportedly</a>\u00a0gave AT&amp;T an extra $3 billion in cash in 2018, and it continues to give the company <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-corporate-income-tax-work\">lower tax rates</a> each year. Despite that, AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/3Q19_Investor%20Briefing.pdf\">said</a> it has cut its workforce from 269,280 employees to 251,840 employees in the past year.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T's capital spending will decline next year despite the company's plan to roll 5G mobile service out nationwide. AT&amp;T already got much of the 5G spending out of the way by purchasing spectrum licenses, and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/ATT%203Q19%20Transcript.pdf\">told investors</a> that the company's \"strong spectrum position will allow for lower capital intensity\" over the next three years.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T has also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/att-cuts-another-1800-jobs-as-it-finishes-fiber-internet-buildout/\">mostly stopped</a> its fiber-to-the-home broadband construction even though large portions of its 21-state territory still have only copper-based DSL service. Fiber deployment isn't stopping completely, as Stephenson said that \"5G requires us to continue deploying fiber.\" But AT&amp;T customers who can't get modern broadband speeds or reliable wireline service in their homes would welcome more capital investment in their neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T's capital investment has an outsized influence on the industry numbers as a whole. As Stephenson said, the $20 billion AT&amp;T plans in 2020 is \"the most aggressive investment in the industry\" even though it's low by AT&amp;T's recent standards.</p>\n<h2>Tax cut, deregulation didn't boost investment</h2>\n<p>AT&amp;T slashing $3 billion off its capital investment will hurt Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai's attempts to claim that his deregulatory initiatives have raised broadband investment. Pai has repeatedly\u00a0<a href=\"//cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pai-capital.pdf\">cited capital-expenditure numbers</a>\u00a0in his\u00a0<a href=\"https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db0426/DOC-344590A1.pdf\">argument</a>\u00a0that net neutrality rules caused broadband providers to reduce investment.</p>\n<p>Pai has also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/ajit-pai-says-broadband-access-is-soaring-and-that-hes-the-one-to-thank/\">taken credit</a> for AT&amp;T's fiber-to-the-home deployment, even though AT&amp;T completed that multi-year project as part of a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/att-gets-directv-merger-approval-must-deploy-fiber-to-12-5m-customers/\">deal with Pai's predecessor</a>, Tom Wheeler. AT&amp;T's decisions to lower capital investment and stop expanding fiber-to-the-home broadband may force Pai to look elsewhere for data to support his deregulatory preferences.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T's lower-than-expected spending forecast for 2020 \"surprised Wall Street analysts,\" <a href=\"https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/atandt-and-verizon-are-stingy-on-capex-despite-5g-deployments/d/d-id/755244\">Light Reading reported today</a>.\u00a0\"The reduction was such that the analysts at Wall Street research firm Cowen lowered their capex forecasts for AT&amp;T to roughly $19 billion in 2021 and 2022, a decrease from their previous forecast of around $21 billion,\" the article said.</p>\n<h2>Comcast, Charter cut cable spending</h2>\n<p>Capital expenditures for other carriers are also lower than expected.\u00a0\"Comcast and Charter missed 3Q expectations for capex and guided 2019 lower than previously planned,\" analysts at Nomura's Instinet wrote in a note to investors, according to Light Reading. \"We have lowered our combined 2019 capex forecast for Comcast and Charter from $14.6 billion to $14.2 billion.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-3rd-quarter-2019-results\">Comcast said</a> its cable division's capital expenditures \"decreased 6.7% to $1.8 billion\" in the quarter.\" For the nine months ending September 30, Comcast cable's \"capital expenditures decreased 11.7% to $4.8 billion,\" the company said. (Comcast's overall capital expenditures increased because of a rise in NBCUniversal spending.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ir.charter.com/static-files/76cf320f-4610-448b-9768-c1a27f2d2c2e\">Charter said</a> that its third-quarter \"capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion compared to $2.1 billion during the third quarter of 2018.\"</p>\n<p>\"Charter currently expects capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures related to mobile, to be slightly below $7 billion in 2019, versus $8.9 billion in 2018,\" the company said.</p>\n<p>Verizon spent $4.4 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter, \"roughly $100 million below most Wall Street expectations,\" but Verizon still expects to hit its full-year forecast of $17 billion to $18 billion in 2019, Light Reading wrote.</p>\n<p><em>Disclosure: The Advance/Newhouse Partnership, which owns 13% of Charter,\u00a0is part of Advance Publications.

(credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.inscom.army.mil/msc/780mib/\">780th Military Intelligence Brigade</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>COLUMBIA, Md.\u2014In a business park that plays home to a number of tech and cybersecurity firms situated strategically between Washington, DC, and Baltimore, there's a two-story building that looks externally like many other office buildings, remarkable this day only for the food trucks in the parking lot and the stream of people in camouflage swarming in and out. The building, called <a href=\"https://dreamport.tech/index.php\">DreamPort</a>, is a collaboration facility leased by US Cyber Command\u2014and on October 18, it was the location of <a href=\"https://www.avengercon.com/\">AvengerCon IV</a>, the latest incarnation of a soldier-led cybersecurity training event that takes the shape of a community hacking conference.</p>\n<p>The event also offered USCYBERCOM a chance to show off DreamPort\u2014and a chance for me to meet with <a href=\"https://www.cybercom.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Display/Article/1651709/executive-director-uscybercom/\">David Luber</a>, the Executive Director of USCYBERCOM.</p>\n<p>\"AvengerCon is an event that is attracting the very best talent both from our DoD participants and also from some of the folks that are working with us outside of the DoD,\" Luber said. \"When you bring those very best cyber experts together, they get to learn, test out new ideas, and work in an environment that is hosted by and for DoD cyber operations community experts. They're working in a community of peers\u2014they get to learn together, they get to fail together. And what we've seen from previous activities with AvengerCon is that it's an exhilarating, fun environment for them to work in, and they learn a ton while they're here. And the private sector benefits because as AvengerCon shows, we're all working on some of the same cyber challenges together.\"</p>\n<p>AvengerCon is an effort to bring the learning environment provided by security conferences such as DEFCON to a military and government community that wouldn't otherwise be available because of cost and bureaucratic complexity. Originally a training event organized by the 781st Military Intelligence Battalion at Fort Meade involving about 100 soldiers, AvengerCon has grown to 600 attendees and has gained the backing of Army Cyber Command and USCYBERCOM.</p>\n\n<p>\"My job, in part, is trying to figure out how to properly train soldiers in a field that doesn't have decades of standard operating procedures and clear paths for training to get to success,\" Capt. Joseph Dooley, an organizer of AvengerCon, told Ars. He said that this type of event offered \"a unique opportunity for soldiers to individually be in a more unstructured environment where they can set their own agenda\"\u2014where they can pick things that they're interested in or feel they need training in without the usual constraints of formal Army training.</p>\n<p>The event \"complements efforts in regular unit training,\" Dooley explained. \"And it gives [attendees] the chance to collaborate with subject-matter experts [and] share and compare tradecraft, best practices, and ideas. This is a very good way to boost our other conventional training.\"</p>\n<p>Sgt. 1st Class Craig Seiler, another member of the AvengerCon organizing committee, said that bringing together people from across the cyber operations community in government provided a boost to the learning opportunities. \"What we've found is mixing all these different types of people\u2014developers, people doing operations\u2014they all do great things separately, but when they get together later on, they say, 'Hey, I really learned something from that analyst or that developer that I've picked up to bring to my current job.'\"</p>\n<p>I attended last year's AvengerCon, held on Fort Meade, at the invitation of the unit organizing the event, the 780th Military Intelligence Brigade (Cyber). While AvengerCon III was clearly a success, this year's expanded event puts AvengerCon on the scale of well-established regional security conferences. The keynote speaker was security researcher Daniel Cuthbert, who is Global Head of Cyber Security Research for Grupo Santander and co-author of the original Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide and the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard. He spoke largely on the issues surrounding information-sharing and collaboration in the cybersecurity realm.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the base</h2>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191017-O-PX639-242-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Keynote speaker Daniel Cuthbert addresses attendees at AvengerCon IV.

Fortunately, the success of AvengerCon drew the attention of US Cyber Command, and the organizers were offered the use of DreamPort for the event's next iteration.</p>\n<p>AvengerCon fits neatly into DreamPort's mission to foster collaboration between US Cyber Command, the rest of the Department of Defense and intelligence community, and industry.</p>\n<p>\"We opened the facility here in Columbia, Maryland, back in the fall of 2018,\" Luber said, \"created under a partnership intermediary agreement between US Cyber Command and the Maryland Innovation and Security Institute [MISI]. We've hosted over 14,000 visitors in this 40,000-square-foot facility, and in June of 2019, MISI signed an expansion lease to double the size of DreamPort by the end of 2020. So, we're really happy about the partnership that we've had so far.\"</p>\n<p>Companies and individuals can come into the unclassified facility to demonstrate capabilities during \"challenges\" and events hosted by the facility looking at specific cybersecurity issues. These include critical infrastructure security events simulated in \"Dream Valley,\" a scale model village connected to actual industrial control systems and other operational technology.</p>\n<h2>Off base</h2>\n<p>DreamPort's planned expansion is probably a good thing, considering how AvengerCon has grown. In the past, the event was limited to Army personnel, but now it includes attendees from across the Department of Defense and other government agencies tied to cyber operations, as well as students and representatives of industry.</p>\n<p>\"We felt we needed to branch out and start making sure that we are supporting the community better each year as we expand,\" said Seiler. \"The growth is great, but it also brings in other woes and requirements.\" The logistics of getting people onto Fort Meade was one of them, Seiler explained\u2014while it provided a natural level of security around the event, using the base made drawing on outside resources difficult and limited who could be brought in to attend.</p>\n<p>\"We found it works better if it's off base,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Using DreamPort opened up the opportunity to add resources provided by outside organizations that \"connect to our mission,\" Seiler said. Those included the \"villages\" at the event brought in by security community organizations\u2014including ICS Village's industrial control systems \"capture the flag\" competition (in which attendees looked for ways to compromise simulated plant hardware) and the Voting Village's collection of voting-machine hardware and exploration of election security.</p>\n<p>\"The election thing was nice to have,\" said Seiler. \"I don't know if it was our big thing, but lots of people are talking about it... it sparks conversation, which was the intent of accepting something like that. That's the intent of all the villages\u2014to build the conversations.\"</p>\n<p>The additional space allowed for the expansion of AvengerCon's training workshops, which included day-long classes in reverse-engineering and software \"fuzzing.\" Additionally, the event hosted a simulation called \"The Day After\"\u2014in which teams from the US Naval Academy, James Madison University, American University, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, simulated strategies for government agencies to respond to a large-scale cyberattack on the United States.</p>\n<h2>More, better cyber</h2>\n<p>The success of AvengerCon has prompted plans to replicate it in some form for the military and intelligence cyber community at Fort Gordon in Georgia. But the organizers also want to make sure that AvengerCon itself doesn't outgrow its grassroots, community feel. They also want it to stay focused on its mission. That fits into the overall USCYBERCOM strategy for DreamPort, which has an ongoing calendar of highly focused events surrounding the command's \"Persistent Innovation\" strategy.</p>\n<p>\"You know that cyberspace is under constant change,\" said Luber. \"It requires us to constantly innovate, and innovation just doesn't happen in government. It's also happening in industry, academia. We need a place to work, we need a place to meet, and we need a place to innovate, and DreamPort provides that combination for us.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to providing an environment for academic outreach to high schools and universities, Luber said DreamPort is \"a mission accelerator, an incubator for US Cyber Command where projects are conducted with the goal of completing those projects within 90 days. So think of that innovation process where you've got an idea, you've got a concept, you want to run it quickly, and if you fail, you fail fast. And if you succeed, you've moved to the next step where you try and get it to operational capabilities.\"</p>\n<p>Conducting those projects in an unclassified environment, Luber said, encourages the sharing of ideas and speeds up the creation of new solutions to cyber security issues.</p>\n<h2>Rapid prototyping</h2>\n<p>Some of those projects include rapid-prototyping events in which \"we bring industry partners in from all different sizes, small businesses, large businesses, and then have them work the problem,\" Luber explained. \"We've had six rapid-prototyping events over the course of the past year. We've seen even one-person companies outperform some of the bigger prime contractors that you might think that we're dealing with on a regular basis.\"</p>\n<p>One of DreamPort's recent rapid-prototyping events was run by USCYBERCOM in partnership with the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Small Business and Manufacturing. It focused on protecting the security of small businesses within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) with the application of \"zero trust\" network security, which is an architectural approach to handling application and information security that would help protect their security regardless of the overall security of the network environment.</p>\n<p>The project looked at ways to apply zero-trust architecture, not just to the DIB, but to Department of Defense information systems and networks as well. \"By bringing together talent from DISA, NSA, USCYBERCOM, and industry, we were able to really work on some interesting prototyping activities, and it's going to help us drive the future for the Department,\" Luber said.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593887&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

But as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we argued at the time</a>, it wasn't quite a fair fight. Now AlphaStar has improved on its performance sufficiently to achieve Grandmaster status in <em>StarCraft II,</em> using the same interface as a human player. The team described its work in <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/alphastar/AlphaStar_unformatted.pdf\">a new paper</a> in Nature.</p>\n<p>\"This is a dream come true,\" said DeepMind co-author Oriol Vinyals, who was an avid <em>StarCraft</em> player 20 years ago. \"AlphaStar achieved Grandmaster level solely with a neural network and general-purpose learning algorithms\u2014which was unimaginable ten years ago when I was researching <em>StarCraft</em> AI using rules-based systems.\"</p>\n<p>Late last year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/move-over-alphago-alphazero-taught-itself-to-play-three-different-games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we reported on</a> the latest achievements of AlphaZero, a direct descendent of DeepMind's AlphaGo, which made headlines worldwide in 2016 by defeating Lee Sedol, the reigning (human) world champion in Go. AlphaGo got <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a major upgrade</a> last year, becoming capable of teaching itself winning strategies with no need for human intervention. By playing itself over and over again, AlphaZero trained itself to play Go from scratch in just three days and soundly defeated the original AlphaGo 100 games to 0. The only input it received was the basic rules of the game. Then AlphaZero <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taught itself</a> to play three different board games (chess, Go, and shogi, a Japanese form of chess) in just three days, with no human intervention.</p>\n<p>The secret ingredient: \"reinforcement learning,\" in which playing itself for millions of games allows the program to learn from experience. This works because AlphaZero is rewarded for the most useful actions (i.e., devising winning strategies). The AI does this by considering the most probable next moves and calculating the probability of winning for each of them. The most recent version combined deep reinforcement learning (many layers of neural networks) with a general-purpose Monte Carlo tree search method. As chess grandmaster <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gary Kasparov wrote</a> in an editorial in Science last year, \"Instead of processing human instructions and knowledge at tremendous speed, as all previous chess machines, AlphaZero generates its own knowledge.\"</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg\"><img alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar&#039;s base, showcasing robustness.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3-640x400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg 2x\" alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar&#039;s base, showcasing robustness.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar's base, showcasing robustness.</a> (credit: DeepMind)</p></div>\n<p>With AlphaZero's success, DeepMind's focus shifted to a new AI frontier: games of partial (incomplete) information, like poker, and multi-player video games like <em>Starcraft II</em>. <em>StarCraft II</em> is also a game of incomplete information, and there is no single best strategy, much like playing rock-paper-scissors. It requires long-range planning ability and real-time decision-making in a large action space. Not only is the gameplay map hidden to players, but they must also control hundreds of units (mobile game pieces that can be built to influence the game) and buildings (used to create units or technologies that strengthen those units) simultaneously. As Ars' Tim Lee (an avid <em>StarCraft</em> player) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote in January</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"<em>StarCraft</em> requires players to gather resources, build dozens of military units, and use them to try to destroy their opponents. <em>StarCraft</em> is particularly challenging for an AI because players must carry out long-term plans over several minutes of gameplay, tweaking them on the fly in the face of enemy counterattacks. DeepMind says that prior to its own effort, no one had come close to designing a <em>StarCraft</em> AI as good as the best human players.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>That earlier version of AlphaStar also relied on deep reinforcement learning to teach the program to mimic human strategies. At that point, the AI was proficient enough to defeat Elite-level players roughly 95% of the time. Then the DeepMind team created variants of that AI, each adopting a different playing style, and placed them into a virtual <em>StarCraft</em> league. This allowed the agents to learn from their mistakes and evolve their strategies accordingly. Then DeepMind selected the five strongest agents and pitted them against two human professional players: Dario \"TLO\" Wunsch and Grzegorz \"MaNa\" Komincz. The AI defeated its human challengers in all ten games.</p>\n<p>That said, it wasn't quite a fair fight. \"The ultimate way to level the playing field would be to make AlphaStar use the exact same user interface as human players,\" <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lee wrote</a> in January. \"The interface could be virtualized, of course, but the game should get the same raw pixel inputs as a human player and should be required to input instructions using a sequence of mouse movements and keystrokes\u2014with inputs limited to speeds that human hands can achieve. This is the only way to be completely sure that AlphaStar isn't giving its software an unfair advantage.\"</p>\n<h2>Playing like a human</h2>\n<p>This latest version of AlphaStar goes a long way toward addressing those issues, combining deep reinforcement learning with multi-agent learning and imitation learning directly from game data, honed once again via a virtual league. <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">Per a blog post</a> by Vinyals and fellow DeepMind co-author\u00a0Wojciech Czarnecki, the new, improved AlphaStar was subject to the same constraints under which humans play, and it played on Battle.net \"using the same maps and conditions as human players.\"</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg\"><img alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2-640x400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg 2x\" alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.</a> (credit: DeepMind)</p></div>\n<p>\"The key insight of the league is that playing to win is insufficient,\" <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">Vinyals and Czarnecki wrote</a> of the improvements to this latest incarnation of AlphaStar. \"Instead, we need both main agents whose goal is to win versus everyone, and also exploiter agents that 'take one for the team.' focusing on helping the main agent grow stronger by exposing its flaws, rather than maximizing their own win rate. Using this training method, the current league learns all its complex <em>StarCraft II</em> strategy in an end-to-end fashion\u2014as opposed to the earlier incarnation of our work, which stitched together agents produced by a variety of methods and algorithms.\"</p>\n<p>The AI can also now play as or against the three races in <em>Starcraft II</em>: Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. (The earlier version only played Protoss vs. Protoss.) DeepMind pitted AlphaStar against human players in a series of online games. The AI was rated at Grandmaster level for all three <em>StarCraft II</em> races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players. It's the first AI to achieve that status in a popular professional e-sport, without using a simplified version of the game. That's a strong indication that these types of general-purpose machine-learning algorithms could be used to solve complex real-world problems such as personal assistants, self-driving cars, or robotics\u2014all of which require real-time decisions on the basis of imperfect information.</p>\n<p>\"At DeepMind, we're interested in understanding the potential\u2014and limitations\u2014of open-ended learning, which enables us to develop robust and flexible agents that can cope with complex real-world domains,\" Vinyals and Czarnecki <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">wrote</a>. \"Games like <em>StarCraft</em> are an excellent training ground to advance these approaches, as players must use limited information to make dynamic and difficult decisions that have ramifications on multiple levels and timescales.\"</p>\n<p>And this time around, it appears to have been a fair fight. \"I've found AlphaStar's gameplay impressive,\" Wunsch said of this most recent incarnation. \"The system is very skilled at assessing its strategic position, and knows exactly when to engage or disengage with its opponent. And while AlphaStar has excellent and precise control, it doesn't feel superhuman\u2014certainly not on a level that a human couldn't theoretically achieve. Overall, it feels very fair\u2014like playing a 'real' game of <em>StarCraft</em>.\"</p>\n<p>DOI: <em>Nature</em>, 2019. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1724-z\">10.1038/s41586-019-1724-z</a> (<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1.ars\">About DOIs</a>).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593543&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

It is a very well-studied crop disease, and it often serves as a model system to examine the interactions between microbes and their host plants. The pathogen is called Xoo, for <em>Xanthomonas oryzae</em> pathovar <em>oryzae</em>, and it makes its living by hijacking a number of rice genes that export sugars.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers have figured out how to edit the rice's genome to block this hijacking.</p>\n<h2>A TALe of sugars</h2>\n<p>Xoo secretes TALes (transcription activator-like effector molecules) that bind to the DNA near the rice's SWEET genes, activating them. These SWEET genes (Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporters) are ubiquitous in plants. As their name indicates, the SWEET proteins transport sucrose across the cell membrane. Their expression is required for susceptibility to Xoo.</p>\n<p>Researchers thought that modifying the rice SWEET genes would confer resistance to Xoo, especially since natural-occurring resistance has arisen this way. But thus far, only a few Xoo strains have been characterized genetically, so it wasn't clear whether it had additional ways of attacking its host.</p>\n<p>In order to see how to most efficiently render the rice resistant to Xoo\u2014which of the rice's SWEET genes to change, and how\u2014an international team of scientists first examined 63 strains of Xoo, 33 from Asia and 30 from Africa. All of them were found to use TALes to induce the expression of SWEET genes.</p>\n<p>As a proof of concept, the scientists then used CRISPR to edit the DNA near three SWEET genes in Kitaake rice. This editing specifically targeted the DNA sequences that the TALe proteins stick to but left the surrounding DNA intact. It's far more specific than could be expected to occur simply by selecting for naturally occurring variants.</p>\n<p>The engineered rice was resistant to all known Xoo strains. The Kitaake cultivar is a variety of <em>japonica</em> rice that is optimal for such studies since it has a quick flowering cycle and high regeneration. In the future, this new resistant line can serve as a diagnostic test to assess the virulence of any new Xoo strains that crop up.</p>\n<h2>Testing on crops</h2>\n<p>Since it is a variety of <em>japonica</em>, it can also be harnessed to breed the resistant trait into Japanese and Chinese rice. But it is not ideal for breeding with the <em>indica</em> varieties that are grown in most of Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>\n<p>So next the team used CRISPR to modify two rice mega varieties\u2014those grown over a million hectares. In paddy experiments, the edited rice grew normally and performed much like its unmodified parents in terms of plant height and other agriculturally relevant metrics. Critically, it was resistant to three representative strains of Xoo. Although encouraging, the researchers note that these results hardly provide a sound base for going out and planting fields of the stuff; much more extensive field trials are required, along with complete sequencing to ensure that CRISPR did not generate any off-target DNA edits.</p>\n<p>Rice has over 20 SWEET genes, and only three are naturally targeted by Xoo. \"Broad resistance to bacterial blight at the SWEET promoters will not prevent adaptation of the pathogen, and the durability of this approach will depend on the ability of Xoo populations to adapt to recessive resistance alleles,\" the authors sagely note. They suggest that making large changes in the SWEET gene promoters might delay Xoo's ability to overcome the engineered resistance.</p>\n<p>Nature Biotechnology, 2019.

Breja is suing Juul for retaliation for whistleblowing, wrongful termination, and other violations.</p>\n<p>Overall, Breja\u2019s complaint paints a dark picture of the company, which owns a lion\u2019s share of the e-cigarette market in the US. The former executive claims that Juul\u2019s senior management was motivated purely by profits and made many efforts to deceive regulators and customers, copying the despised tactics of Big Tobacco companies and trying to get customers addicted to their products.</p>\n<p>Breja accuses ex-CEO Kevin Burns of managing the company like a dictator, operating in a \u201cwin-at-all-costs, reckless fashion,\u201d and fostering a \u201cculture of silence.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Breja raised concerns about the company selling expired or soon-to-be expired products, Burns allegedly responded: \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fo\u2019s, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Toxic claims</h2>\n<p>Perhaps more concerning, Breja alleges that Juul sold a large amount of contaminated products out of greed. According to Breja, the company struggled to keep up with demand for mint-flavored products after Juul decided <a href=\"https://newsroom.juul.com/juul-labs-action-plan/\">to pull other flavors from its retail stores</a> late last year. The move was meant to dodge further public backlash for the rise in teen vaping, but it resulted in supply issues that threatened profits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don\u2019t find mango they buy mint,\u201d Burns allegedly said while berating Juul\u2019s supply-chain team and its suppliers for the shortages.</p>\n<p>In March of 2019, Breja learned that some batches of Mint eLiquid had been found to be contaminated. By that time, approximately 250,000 \u201cMint Refill Kits\u201d containing the contaminated liquids had already been shipped to retailers and were being sold to customers. The contaminated kits were equivalent to one million pods, the lawsuit notes.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit does not indicate what the contaminant might be. But Breja\u2019s suit notes that the contamination issue arose \u201cin the wake of consumers recently having reported suffering seizures due to the use of Juul\u2019s products.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an emailed statement to Ars, a Juul spokesperson responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Breja\u2019s claims are baseless. He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role. The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.</p></blockquote>\n<p> Breja\u2019s claims come at a critical time for Juul. The company is facing intense criticism for helping to light up an epidemic of youth vaping, particularly after revelations this summer that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/juul-gave-presentations-in-schools-to-kids-and-the-fda-is-fuming/\">Juul directly pitched its products to teens while they were in school</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the country is dealing with a rash of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/vaping-linked-lung-illness-looks-like-exposure-to-mustard-gas-doctors-say/\">unexplained lung injuries that have been linked to vaping</a>. Federal and state health investigators have not been able to determine what vaping products or contaminants could be causing the illnesses, but most cases have involved black-market products containing THC (the psychoactive component of cannabis)\u2014not nicotine products or Juul products, specifically.</p>\n<p>As of October 22, 2019, there have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information\">been 1,604 reported cases of vaping-related injuries</a> in 49 states, including 34 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kevin Burns stepped down as Juul\u2019s CEO in September. He was replaced by K. C. Crosthwaite, the former chief growth officer at Altria Group Inc., formerly Philip Morris Companies, Inc., before the appointment. On Tuesday, the company confirmed plans to lay off 500 employees by the end of the year as part of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-to-cut-about-500-jobs-11572301778\">necessary reset</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593843&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

(credit:  Bloomberg via Getty Images)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) has acknowledged today that malware attributed by others to North Korean state actors had been found on the administrative network of the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP). The admission comes a day after the company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/indian-nuke-plants-network-reportedly-hit-by-malware-tied-to-n-korea/\">issued a denial</a> that any attack would affect the plant's control systems.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/432675681/NPC-Admission-on-Malware-Attack#download\">press release today</a>, NPCIL\u00a0Associate Director A. K. Nema stated, \"Identification of malware in NPCIL system is correct. The matter was conveyed by CERT-In [India's national computer emergency response team] when it was noticed by them on September 4, 2019.\"</p>\n<p>That matches the date threat analyst Pukhraj Singh said he reported information on the breach to India's National Cyber Security Coordinator.</p>\n<p>\"The matter was immediately investigated by [India Department of Atomic Energy] specialists,\" Nema stated in the release. \"The investigation revealed that the infected PC belonged to a user who was connected to the Internet connected network used for administrative purposes. This is isolated from the critical internal network. The networks are being continuously monitored.\"</p>\n<h2>Lazarus in the house</h2>\n<p>It's not clear if data was stolen from the KKNPP network. But the nuclear power plant was not the only facility Singh reported being compromised. When asked by Ars why he called the malware attack a \"casus belli\"\u2014an act of war\u2014Singh, a former analyst for India's National Technical Research Organization (NTRO), said, \"It was because of the second target, which I can't disclose as of now.\"</p>\n<p>The malware in question, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/busy-north-korean-hackers-have-new-malware-to-target-atms/\">named Dtrack by Russian malware protection company Kaspersky</a>, has been used in widespread attacks against financial and research centers, based on Kaspersky data collected from over 180 samples of the malware. Dtrack shares elements of code from other malware attributed to the Lazarus threat group, which,\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/09/us-indicts-north-korean-agents-for-wannacry-sony-attacks/\">according to US Justice Department indictments,</a> is a North Korean state-sponsored hacking operation. Another version of the malware, ATMDtrack, has been used to steal data from ATM networks in India.</p>\n<p>DTrack appears to be an espionage and reconnaissance tool, gathering data about infected systems and capable of logging keystrokes, scanning connected networks, and monitoring active processes on infected computers. The malware may have been delivered by an \"in-memory implant,\" Singh said, though he added that he is waiting for confirmation from other sources. He added that he had not seen any data indicating whether data had been stolen from the KKNPP network. \"I didn't have the full indicators,\" Singh said.</p>\n<p>While the attack may not have given direct access to nuclear power control networks, it could have been part of an effort to establish a persistent presence on the nuclear plant's networks. As a <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/document/potential-human-cost-cyber-operations\">paper published in May by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the human cost of cyber operations</a> pointed out, \u201cthe majority of the computer devices in the world are only one or two steps away from a trusted system that a determined attacker could compromise.\" Lukasz Olejnik, a security researcher who co-authored the paper,<a href=\"https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/icrc-report-on-cyberoperations/\"> noted that</a> \"preemptive compromise of trusted systems would make attacks significantly easier,\" and that establishing a persistent presence on a network could aid in things such as supply-chain attacks\u2014attempts to use software update processes or other potential opportunities to move to isolated networks to deliver an attack in the future.</p>\n<p>That's similar to the route demonstrated by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/confirmed-us-israel-created-stuxnet-lost-control-of-it/\">Stuxnet,</a> the malware attributed to US and Israeli intelligence that managed to jump an \"air gap\" into Iranian nuclear enrichment equipment controls. While the administrative network of KKNPP was likely not a good route for such an attack given standards for nuclear control systems security, it certainly could provide information about maintenance operations that would be useful for espionage\u2014or for a future attempted cyber-attack.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593755&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

Moore, explicitly takes that <em>what if</em> as its core premise and logline, asking: what if the space race never ended?</p>\n<p>The show's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/apple-debuts-first-trailer-for-sci-fi-tv-series-for-all-mankind/\">first trailer</a> showed us the motivation for continuing the race: what if, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union was first to put a man on the moon? What if Apollo 11, rather than a great leap for mankind, was a footnote in the history books? What would that <em>mean</em>, and what would happen next?</p>\n<p>It feels intentional that Apple should launch its new streaming TV service with a show literally about launching, about refusing to accept second place as a loss, about the audacity of reaching for the literal stars. And it seems fitting that the company would have shared the first two episodes of that vision on the larger-than-life IMAX screen at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC, surrounded by <a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/lunar-module-2-apollo\">actual artifacts</a> of <a href=\"https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/capsule-gemini-iv\">crewed spaceflight</a> on all sides.</p>\n<p>Alas that the screening was only two episodes because yours truly left the theater dying to see what comes next.</p>\n<p><strong>(Very minor spoilers for the first two episodes of <em>For All Mankind</em> follow.)</strong></p>\n<h2>Larger than life</h2>\n<p>It has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/apollo-the-greatest-leap/\">50 years</a> since Neil Armstrong's \"one small step\" ricocheted around the world. The men who went to space on Apollo 11 are now iconic and legendary; most people can name either Buzz Aldrin or Neil Armstrong, if not both, even if they can't remember Michael Collins (who remained in orbit).</p>\n<p>Astronauts captivated\u2014continue to captivate\u2014our imagination. A few hundred souls, out of all the billions who have ever lived, have escaped our world, seen it from the outside with their own eyes. The men of Apollo 11 were legends in their own time and in ours. And they, like their mission, are a sideline in <em>For All Mankind</em>, which instead elevates the stories of others to mythic status in their own right.</p>\n<p>Instead, as the series begins, the figures looming over it are not those flying high above, but those feuding down below. Our story follows astronaut Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman), a stand-in for real-life Apollo 10 commander Thomas Stafford. Apollo 10 served as a \"dress rehearsal\" for the eventual Moon landing, with astronauts in a lunar module descending to within about eight miles of the lunar surface before returning to orbit.</p>\n<p>In our history, where Apollo 11 was a success, that level of preparation and testing seemed wise. In an alternate history, where Apollo 11 came too late, the choice <em>not</em> to land earlier suddenly looms large, kicking off internecine political conflict at every level.</p>\n<p>Baldwin is joined by colleague and foil Gordo Stevens (Michael Dorman), a replacement for real-life Apollo 10 lunar module pilot Eugene Cernan. Where Baldwin is the square-jawed, right-stuff astronaut trope made manifest, Stevens embodies the hard-drinking, philandering, hotshot fighter pilot. Each of the men of course has a wife to match, and the women, too, are foils to each other. Karen Baldwin (Shantel VanSanten) seemingly strives to be the housewife and mother the still-military atmosphere of NASA circa 1969 demands, while Tracy Stevens (Sarah Jones) exhibits markedly less patience for the constraints that life can bring with it.</p>\n<p>The plot also makes room for two other threads, both telling the stories of girls and women who chafe against their circumstances. Margo Madison (Wrenn Schmidt) replaces the real-life <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/07/inside-apollo-mission-control-seen-by-first-woman-engineer-poppy-northcutt/\">Poppy Northcutt</a> as the first (and, at the time, only) woman sitting inside mission control during Apollo. Madison is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wernher von Braun (Colm Feore), the real-life director of the Marshall Space Flight Center and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/history/vonbraun/bio.html\">architect</a> of the Saturn V rocket.</p>\n<p>The challenges Madison faces are perhaps the ones you might expect for a woman trying to be taken seriously in an all-male workplace in the 1960s. What you might not expect, however, is the third plot thread, which follows young Aleida Rosales (Olivia Trujillo) and her family as they emigrate from Mexico to Houston in pursuit of the good-old American dream.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/For_All_Mankind_Unit_Photo_03.jpg\"><img alt='Astronaut Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman) flying the Apollo 10 mission.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/For_All_Mankind_Unit_Photo_03-640x427.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/For_All_Mankind_Unit_Photo_03-1280x853.jpg 2x\" alt='Astronaut Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman) flying the Apollo 10 mission.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/For_All_Mankind_Unit_Photo_03.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Astronaut Ed Baldwin (Joel Kinnaman) flying the Apollo 10 mission.</a> (credit: Apple)</p></div>\n<h2>As real as fiction gets</h2>\n<p>I would be remiss to discuss a show made with the budget and care applied to <em>For All Mankind</em> and not address the obvious hook: the space porn.</p>\n<p>The scenes taking place in space, screened at a state-of-the-art IMAX facility, were a joy. Every shot of the <em>Columbia</em> and <em>Eagle</em> gliding silently (yes, silently) through space, of a massive rocket readying for liftoff, of Baldwin and Stevens folded into a lander that would never land, delivers all the wonder that feats of human engineering deserve. And in every element, <em>For All Mankind</em> displays painstaking attention to detail.</p>\n<p>\"We said from the beginning of the production to all the departments that we thought it was really important for the show to have a sense of authenticity to it, even though you were doing something that was fundamentally not true,\" Moore said during a Q&amp;A panel after the screening.</p>\n<p>Moore added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The closer it was to reality, the more likely it was that the audience would go on this journey\u2014take the risk and laugh and cry with the characters along the way. So, every department on the show, in the writers' room, had researchers and historians. We went back to the original NASA plans whenever possible.</p>\n<p>Our production designer, Dan Fisher, who designed all the sets of the show, recreated Mission Control in such exacting detail that even the ceiling tiles [are] the same as the ceiling tiles in the original mission control. When we were on set, we had technical consultants and former astronauts who were actually there, who would walk the cast through how to operate the command module and the lunar module. We had people that would talk to the background players in Mission Control, so that people weren't just randomly pushing buttons\u2014they knew exactly what the console did and who they were talking to on those headsets, and that permeated the entire production.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The sense of authenticity shoots straight through every scene. Interstitial moments use as much original footage as possible for key political figures such as Presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon, and the soundtrack drips with 1960s rock and pop throughout, helping ground the audience in a strong sense of time and place.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/For_All_Mankind_Unit_Photo_05.jpg\"><img alt='Man on the moon?

And indeed, both the workaday questions of funding and who saves face, as well as the grander philosophical questions were already on display in just two episodes.</p>\n<p><em>Mankind</em> begins during the early months of the Nixon administration, locked into the Manichean worldview of the Cold War. But in the same way <em>Battlestar</em> was grappling with a post-9/11 world, <em>Mankind</em> is in every way, inescapably, a show made in and about the Trump era. Moore and company ask us in the subtext of almost every single scene not only to grapple with the <em>what ifs</em> underlying US politics and the history of NASA but also something much more profound.</p>\n<p>Sometime after the third episode, we know from the trailers, the alternate-universe NASA of <em>For All Mankind</em> is going to try something that our real NASA <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/04/netflix-film-examines-why-nasa-shunned-women-astronauts-in-early-days/\">had already rejected</a> in 1969: admitting women as astronaut candidates (including wronged wife Tracy Stevens).</p>\n<p>According to promo photos, at least one of the potential women astronauts in this alternate universe is African-American. In the real world, an American woman would not reach orbit until 1983, when Sally Ride became the first. It also took until 1983 for Guion Bluford, the first black US astronaut, to reach space. (Although NASA was at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/ed-dwight-was-set-to-be-the-first-black-astronaut-heres-why-that-never-happened.html\">thinking about desegregating space</a> in the 1960s.) Almost another decade had to go by before NASA sent a black woman, Mae Jemison, into space on a 1992 mission.</p>\n<p>What if we were motivated to try something new and different decades earlier due to an embarrassing Cold War loss? </p>\n<p>The show is both \"a look at what might have been\u2014and what still might be,\" Moore said in introductory remarks, and even in the first two episodes, <em>For All Mankind</em> demands of the viewer a reckoning. The first shots of an eager world watching the Moon landing take place not in Florida, Houston, or Washington, DC, or even in Soviet Russia. They happen in Mexico. In one of the most profoundly human moments of the first episode, a family comes together, speaking subtitled Spanish, to watch one of humanity's greatest achievements to date and remember.</p>\n<p>In the second episode, an influential congressman wants to leverage a disillusioned astronaut into a showboating hearing that will allow him to move the players around Washington like pawns on a chessboard. The astronaut chooses to go to Washington\u2014but then shoulders responsibility and blame himself rather than offloading it onto the congressman's chosen target.</p>\n<p>What if, rather than dodging responsibility, our leaders embraced it?</p>\n<p>What if, the show asks us, over and over again, in scene after scene after scene. What if we respected our rivals' accomplishments and used them to spur our own advancement? What if we expanded our view of who matters? What if duty, honor, and country were genuinely guiding principles?</p>\n<p>The pointed parallels are too many to ignore. If <em>For All Mankind</em> is truly a look at what still might be, then it wants us to think beyond space and look around closer to home to consider what that means.</p>\n<p>For All Mankind <em>premieres with three episodes on Apple TV+ on Friday, November 1, before moving to a weekly release format for the remainder of the season.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1592213&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

We had already seen <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/07/att-starts-restricting-time-warner-shows-to-its-own-streaming-service/\">a number of announcements about existing and classic series</a> coming to the service, but now we know <a href=\"https://pressroom.warnermediagroup.com/na/media-release/hbo-max/warnermedia-unveils-hbo-max\">its launch window and price</a>: $14.99/month, starting in May 2020.</p>\n<p>Let's start with some asterisks on that price point. While $15 is the highest point in the current streaming-video fray, AT&amp;T Time Warner already charges $15/mo for HBO Now, and HBO Max will effectively make the existing service redundant. Should you already pay for HBO as part of an AT&amp;T cable-TV subscription package, you'll get HBO Max access for free. However, that may not be the case if you pay for HBO through other cable providers; \"we are in active discussions with our distributors and look forward to offering their customers seamless access to this great product,\" the company said in a statement.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you don't pay for HBO but subscribe to any of AT&amp;T's \"premium video, mobile, and broadband services,\" you\u00a0<em>might</em> be offered free HBO Max service... if you upgrade to a new AT&amp;T bundle package \"at no additional charge.\" Whether those new bundles will require specific terms or additional purchases remains unclear, however.</p>\n<p>After its paid launch in 2020, WarnerMedia plans to launch an \"ad-supported\" version of HBO Max in 2021, but the company wasn't ready to reveal how that would work (ie, whether such a product would combine a monthly fee and advertisements a la the ad-supported Hulu tier). In terms of regions, WarnerMedia says HBO Max will premiere in the US in 2020 and will expand to Latin America and Europe by 2025. (Really? No hints about Canada yet?)</p>\n<h2><em>House</em> odds</h2>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hbo-got-prequel-980x1452.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Arguably the biggest announcement at Tuesday's HBO Max event was an announcement of a new <em>Game of Thrones</em> series, but it's likely not an HBO Max exclusive.                      [credit:\n                        WarnerMedia                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>We already knew that HBO Max had secured the streaming rights to TV series like <em>Friends</em> and <em>Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em>, along with a truckload of content from the likes of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/hbo-max-secures-exclusive-usa-streaming-rights-for-dr-who-other-bbc-series/\">BBC America</a>. The past week has seen WarnerMedia announce <a href=\"https://pressroom.warnermediagroup.com/na/brands/hbo-max/media-releases\">a bunch of new, original direct-to-Max content</a>, and the company capped off its Tuesday event with a few more announcements.</p>\n<p>Arguably the biggest, albeit least surprising, was official word that a previously announced <em>Game of Thrones</em> prequel series has a name: <em>House of the Dragon</em>. As anticipated, this series, which has at least one ten-episode season on order, will be based on the 2018 George R. R. Martin book, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, so it will revolve around the history of House\u00a0Targaryen 300 years before the events of the primary <em>Game of Thrones</em> book and TV series.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/heres-what-we-know-so-far-about-long-awaited-game-of-thrones-prequel/\">Multiple prequel projects had been rumored</a>, however, and it's unclear whether to expect others. (In fact, on Tuesday, we heard word that <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/game-of-thrones-prequel-pilot-dead-hbo-jane-goldman-naomi-watts-1202771609/\">one rumored prequel project was canceled</a> before being officially announced.) WarnerMedia did not confirm whether <em>House of the Dragon</em>, or any of the company's other freshly announced shows and one-off specials, would be ready in time for the service's May 2020 launch.</p>\n<p>HBO Max finally claimed dibs on <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, a ten-episode TV series from showrunner and Director Ridley Scott, which had originally been pegged as a TNT original series. Meanwhile, the company's comic-minded teams at DC Entertainment showed up to announce <a href=\"https://pressroom.warnermediagroup.com/na/media-release/hbo-max/greg-berlanti-announces-new-dc-projects-hbo-max-strange-adventures-and-green-lantern\">a few live-action HBO Max exclusives</a>, including a high-school drama produced by Elizabeth Banks (<em>Pitch Perfect</em>), a superhero anthology series with criss-crossing tales, and a very vaguely worded \"Green Lantern-inspired series.\" (This three-series coup, on top of other DC-related exclusives on HBO Max, sure make us wonder how long the standalone DC Universe streaming service will last.)</p>\n<p>In addition to today's list of new series, WarnerMedia announced the following existing series would become streaming exclusives on HBO Max during its \"first year\" of operation:\u00a0<em>South Park</em>, <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>, <em>The O.C.</em>, <em>Aqua Teen Hunger Force</em>, <em>Robot Chicken</em>, <em>Space Ghost Coast to Coast</em>, <em>The Bachelor</em>, <em>Impractical Jokers</em>, <em>The Closer</em>, <em>Rizzolli and Isles</em>, <em>Major Crimes</em>, <em>The Alienist</em>, <em>The West Wing</em>, <em>United Shades of America with Kamau Bell</em>, <em>This is Life with Lisa Ling</em>, and <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em>. Of everything on that list, <em>South Park</em> is arguably the biggest WarnerMedia coup, since that likely means a deal was worked out with Viacom\u2014which already operates CBS All Access, itself a paid streaming-video service.</p>\n<p>Really, thinking about the ecosystem of existing streaming services leads us to ask: will HBO Max land with a bang or a thud? By the time May 2020 rolls around, we will have already seen months of activity from this November's new services,\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/see-on-apple-tv-less-game-of-thrones-more-unintentionally-funny-syfy/\">Apple TV+</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/we-now-know-what-disney-will-look-like-plus-a-few-new-exclusive-series/\">Disney+</a>, not to mention the April 2020 launch of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/nbc-peacock-adds-to-streaming-glut-next-april-with-15000-hours-of-shows/\">NBC Peacock</a>. Will the \"costs the same as HBO Now\" argument help WarnerMedia's new service rise to the top of the competitive streaming pool? We suppose that depends on whether potential subscribers have been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/disney-fights-streaming-account-sharing-with-help-from-cable-industry/\">sharing accounts</a> this whole time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593719&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

While iPhones and iPads are powerful devices on their own, they can be enhanced by accessories that protect them, let you use them in different ways, and make them work harder for you.</p>\n<p>But sifting through the plethora of cases, cables, keyboards, adapters and other accessories available today is a daunting task. It's made even harder thanks to all the different companies making accessories\u2014while that means you can find iPhone and iPad accessories to fit any budget, it also means that not all of those accessories are worth buying (the cheapest option isn't always the way to go, nor is the most expensive option the best out there).</p>\n<p>To make things easier for you, Ars has spent the fall testing a slew of iPhone and iPad accessories in order to find the best and most useful ones that are worth your hard-earned dollars.</p>\n<p><em>Note: Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales

family of cords are arguably better than Apple's own lightning cables because they're built to last longer and they're MFi-certified. The double-braided nylon cables won't break or fray like others might, and they come in different lengths so you don't have to be so physically close to a power source while you're charging your iPhone or iPad. They also support iPhone fast charging when connected to Apple or other Anker PD chargers. While a charging cable is only one part of the puzzle in terms of power delivery and charging speed, Anker's Powerline+ II cords are solid options that provide all of the features you'd get from an Apple cable plus even better build quality and value for the money.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ankerpl-300x375.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"Anker PowerLine+ II USB-C to Lightning Cable product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Anker PowerLine+ II USB-C to Lightning Cable                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_95421200\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/31H1lQe\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $21.99 from Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best portable battery pack</h2>\n<h3>Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux</h3>\n<h3>ZMI PowerPack 20000</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ZMI-and-Anker-battery-packs-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The ZMI PowerPack 20000 (left) and the Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux (center) next to a 10.5-inch iPad Air.

If you need a battery to primarily charge an iPhone, get <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FiPhone-Bank-Max-10000mAh-18W-Pro-USB-C-More-iPad-Charger-S10-11-11-11-Anker-PowerCore-2018-Portable-Redux-PD-3-3XL-10000-8-X-XS-Delivery-Samsung-Powe%2F257587388&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anker\u2019s PowerCore 10000 PD Redux</a>. It\u2019s not the cheapest device in its class, but it has an 18W USB-C Power Delivery (PD) that can safely charge newer iPhones (and most other <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/samsung-makes-the-galaxy-note-10-official/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">non-Galaxy Note 10+</a> phones) at maximum speeds. The battery itself can recharge quickly at 18W through that USB-C PD port. There\u2019s a USB-A port rated at 12W beyond that, though the whole pack can only output 18W in total at a time.</p>\n\n<p>Still, its 10,000mAh (or 36Wh) capacity is enough to get an iPhone 11 roughly two charges. There\u2019s a USB-C to USB-C charging cable in the box. And most notably, it\u2019s supremely portable, weighing less than seven ounces and measuring just 106\u00d752.3\u00d725.5mm. That means it can easily fit in a pants pocket or handbag. Having this kind of fast-charging power in a design that\u2019s this small and well-built makes the PowerCore 10000 PD Redux ideal for travel. Just remember that you need an MFi-certified <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/guidemaster-ars-tested-and-found-the-best-usb-c-accessories-you-can-get-now/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USB-C</a> to Lightning cable like the PowerLine+ II above to actually take advantage of its fast charging speeds with an iPhone.</p>\n<p>If you need a battery pack for charging a newer iPad, meanwhile, get the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JwHcpQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ZMI PowerPack 20000</a>. It includes a 45W USB-C PD port that\u2019s powerful enough to charge the latest iPad Pros\u2014and various 12- and 13-inch laptops\u2014at their fastest possible rate. (Those laptops just have to charge at 15V/3A, as the PowerPack maxes out at 40W of power at a 20V charge.) There are two USB-A ports that output around 12W of power alongside that, though the whole pack can only output a maximum of 45W at any given time. The 20,000mAh (or 72Wh) capacity is enough to give roughly</p>\n<p>one and a half charges to an 11-inch iPad Pro. It\u2019s not USB-IF certified, but we\u2019ve used it safely for about a year now, and there are no widespread reports of failure across the Web. Again, the PowerPack 20000 stands out in the design department: its metallic finish feels premium, and at 14 ounces and 160\u00d782\u00d721mm, it\u2019s more compact than most power banks with this level of power. Plus, at $70, it\u2019s more affordable than most of its peers, and it includes a USB-C to USB-C fast charging cable in the box.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box

and Nekteck 4-port 72W USB-C PD Charger (right).\n                      [credit:\n                        Jeff Dunn                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Though Apple now includes an 18W fast charger in the box with new iPhone 11 Pros, the vast majority of iOS devices continue to ship with power adapters that don\u2019t take full advantage of their charging capabilities. Unfortunately, you still have to pay extra for a good third-party USB-C PD wall charger in order to refill most iPhones and iPads as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>We have a couple of preferred options: if you need a charger for your desk, try <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGalaxy-C-Wall-S8-Pixel-S8-Black-4-port-USB-IF-Nekteck-Pro-Charger-72W-60W-MacBook-Type-C-USB-Plus-Station-2017-PD-XL-Note-8-Certified-Delivery-Charge%2F618192493&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nekteck\u2019s 4-port 72W USB-C PD Charger</a>. It\u2019s a small brick that plugs into an outlet and carries four charging ports, including a 60W USB-C PD port that can easily charge all iPhones and iPads at max speeds (and charge various laptops to boot). There are three 12W USB-A ports as well, so you can refill an iPhone and iPad simultaneously, albeit with one device charging at less-than-optimum speeds. (As its name implies, the device can output a maximum of 72W at once.) There\u2019s a USB-C to USB-C charging cable in the box, and the charger is USB-IF certified, meaning it has been verified to work safely by the body that maintains the USB standard.</p>\n<p>For a wall charger that you can take with you more easily, we like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NnIp3G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RAVPower\u2019s PD Pioneer 45W GaN Wall Charger</a>. As you might guess, this charger uses gallium nitride (GaN), a semiconductor that allows chargers like this to provide the power of traditional silicon in a smaller footprint. Its rectangular design measures 72\u00d754\u00d714.2mm and weighs 2.6 ounces, which makes it significantly smaller and slimmer than a traditional wall charger. It\u2019s more elongated than other GaN chargers like <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32VvpZE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anker\u2019s PowerPort Atom PD 1</a>, so it might take up more room on a power strip, but its foldable prongs and slim profile makes it easier to squeeze into tighter spaces. (Between an outlet and a piece of furniture, for instance.)</p>\n<p>There\u2019s only one port here, but it\u2019s a 45W USB-C PD connector that, again, is capable of charging all iPhones and iPads as fast as possible. This one isn\u2019t USB-IF certified and technically goes against the official USB-C spec by supporting Quick Charge 3.0 over its port, but various chargers have done that in the past without issue. We couldn\u2019t find any sustained complaints over reliability online, and we\u2019ve tested the charger with various devices over the past several months with no problems. It\u2019s not the most affordable 45W wall charger, and you\u2019ll need to supply your own USB-C to Lightning or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WuRegx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USB-C to USB\u2013C cable</a>, but we think the combination of power and travel-friendly design is worth a few bucks extra.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n

apart by providing the most energy in a short amount of time. On average, smartphones had 34% juice after just one hour sitting on the RAVPower charging pad, so you'll get a solid amount of juice in your device even if you have little time to spare for charging. It may not be the fanciest looking charger or even the thinnest we've come across, but it still has a solid design that is made better by rubberized rings on its top and bottom that prevent the pad from moving and prevent your smartphone from sliding off.</p>\n<p>We also appreciate that RAVPower includes a fast-charge capable AC adapter with this pad, so you're guaranteed to get max charging speeds without needing any additional adapters. If you want a wireless charging pad that looks a bit nicer, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2q2yo49\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mophie's Charge Stream Pad+</a> is a good option that performs nearly as well in terms of charging time, but it costs a bit more money.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/51Vxr2JGnqL._SL1000_ravpower034-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"RAVPower RP-PC034 product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">RAVPower RP-PC034                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_28336389\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/32GnTC1\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $29.99 from Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best W1/H1 headphones</h2>\n<h3>Beats Powerbeats Pro</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro.jpg\"><img alt='The Beats Powerbeats Pro.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro-640x363.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro-1280x726.jpg 2x\" alt='The Beats Powerbeats Pro.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Beats-Powerbeats-Pro.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Beats Powerbeats Pro.</a> (credit: Jeff Dunn)</p></div>For better or worse, modern iOS devices are adamant about making you use Bluetooth headphones. The iPhone ditched the headphone jack back in 2016, the iPad Pro followed suit last year, and neither looks likely to bring it back any time soon. Along the way, Apple has furthered a trend in which a manufacturer\u2019s headphones work best with its own platform.</p>\n<p>In this case, headphones with Apple\u2019s H1 and W1 wireless chips\u2014which are currently exclusive to Apple\u2019s AirPods and headphones from the company\u2019s Beats subsidiary\u2014are more convenient to use with iPhones and iPads. They have a simplified pairing process, immediately get remembered across your iCloud devices, keep a more stable and power-efficient wireless connection, and, with H1 headphones, let you access Siri just by saying \u201cHey Siri.\u201d So while there are <em>tons</em> of pairs that sound better and may be more comfortable to wear, Apple\u2019s own pairs present the least friction\u2014again, for better or worse.</p>\n<p>We're still in the process of testing the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">just-announced AirPods Pro</a>, but if you don\u2019t mind giving in to ecosystem lock-in, our favorite Apple-made headphones<em> for now</em> are the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones-Black%2F128591554&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beats Powerbeats Pro</a>. They\u2019re true wireless earphones that do everything the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">regular AirPods</a> do, but better. They have a more dynamic sound, for one: like any true wireless headphone, they\u2019re still limited in soundstage and finer detail, but their bass-forward profile is lively and fun, if not exactly accurate. This is largely due to the Powerbeats Pro creating a tighter seal in the ear: it\u2019s not <em>airtight</em>, so the outside wo\u00adrld won\u2019t be blocked out completely, but it lets in far less noise than the AirPods, which can be difficult to use in louder environments.</p>\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro\u2019s battery life is far superior to any other true wireless headphone we\u2019ve used, lasting about 11 hours per charge in our testing\u2014where we stream music to headphones continuously at 67% volume\u2014with a total of 24 hours advertised through its charging case. By comparison, Apple rates the AirPods and AirPods Pro at five hours each, again bumped up to 24 with their charging cases. Either way, the Powerbeats Pro pair just as easily with iOS devices and keep just as reliable a Bluetooth connection\u2014they can still experience dropouts in extremely hectic environments (think something like Times Square) but that remains the case with most true wireless pairs.</p>\n<p>Their design is more agreeable, too. Whereas the AirPods can tend to hang loose in the ear, the sporty ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro keep them nice and secure, even during intense workouts and runs. Their IPX4 sweat-resistance rating is relatively mild for exercise-minded earphones, but it\u2019s equal to the AirPods Pro and a step up from the AirPods, which have no formal rating at all. Beyond that, they have physical playback and volume buttons that are mirrored on each earpiece, instead of relying on less precise touch controls. (And in the AirPods Pro's case, having no built-in volume controls whatsoever.)</p>\n<p>There are two major drawbacks to the Powerbeats Pro. First, their case is almost comically huge, to the point where it could be difficult to fit in most pants pockets. You\u2019ll usually want to leave it at home or in a separate bag. Second, they're undeniably expensive: at $250, and without any special app-driven features or active noise cancellation a la the AirPods Pro, they certainly carry the \u201ctax\u201d that typically comes with the Beats/Apple branding. The AirPods and the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Solo3-Wireless-On-Ear-Headphones%2F54594385&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">on-ear Beats Solo 3 Wireless</a> are decent alternatives with similar W1/H1 chip benefits if you want something slightly more affordable.

The simplest would be to <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?subId1=iOSAccessoriesGM&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLightning-to-3-5-mm-Headphone-Jack-Adapter%2F54738078\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">buy a Lightning-to-3.5mm dongle</a>: it\u2019s not an elegant solution, and it\u2019s frustrating that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/apple-wont-include-a-headphone-jack-dongle-with-new-iphones-anymore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple no longer packages one</a> with new iPhones, but it\u2019s only $9 and works easily enough. With newer iPad Pros, it\u2019s the same deal, only you\u2019d need a <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?subId1=iOSAccessoriesGM&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FUSB-C-to-3-5-mm-Headphone-Jack-Adapter%2F152170496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USB-C to 3.5mm dongle</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want at least some of the convenience of a wireless headphone, however, you could buy a Bluetooth headphone adapter. This pairs with your phone or tablet over Bluetooth, receives that source device\u2019s audio, and sends it to whatever pair of 3.5mm headphones you plug into the adapter. You\u2019re then free to keep your device charging across the room, keep it in a separate pocket or bag, and generally use it without any wires attached.</p>\n<p>Of the Bluetooth headphone adapters we\u2019ve tested, our favorite is the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32TeBCF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fiio \u03bcBTR</a>. It paired as easily as any other modern Bluetooth device and presented no significant connection hiccups or latency issues in testing. Sending audio over Bluetooth means an inherent loss in audio quality compared to a wired connection, but for what it is the \u03bcBTR doesn\u2019t sacrifice too much fidelity. Importantly, it supports the AAC audio codec, which makes music sound noticeably sharper on an iPhone or iPad than the default SBC codec. (It also supports aptX if you ever use it with a Mac or Android device.) Just know that if your headphones have a particularly high impedance, you\u2019ll likely need to turn up the volume a bit higher than usual.</p>\n<p>The \u03bcBTR\u2019s stick-style design is tiny and easily portable, with a built-in clip that neatly attaches to a pants or shirt pocket. There are dedicated buttons for volume, pause/play, and voice assistant activation, though its volume level won\u2019t sync with your source device. Its 8-9 hours of battery life should be enough to get through a typical workday, and it charges quickly through a USB-C port. The built-in mic isn\u2019t great for making calls or using Siri, but it\u2019s at least there in a pinch. It\u2019d still be nice if your iPhone didn\u2019t make devices like this desirable in the first place, but for $30, the \u03bcBTR isn\u2019t a huge investment for something that effectively makes your most beloved headphones more convenient on the go.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/filo-300x194.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"Fiio \u03bcBTR product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Fiio \u03bcBTR                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_11865221\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/32TeBCF\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $27.99 from Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best portable speaker</h2>\n<h3>UE Wonderboom 2</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UE-Wonderboom-2.jpg\"><img alt='The UE Wonderboom 2.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UE-Wonderboom-2-640x427.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UE-Wonderboom-2-1280x854.jpg 2x\" alt='The UE Wonderboom 2.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/UE-Wonderboom-2.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">The UE Wonderboom 2.</a> (credit: Jeff Dunn)</p></div>While the built-in speakers on iPhones and iPads have improved as the years have rolled on\u2014particularly on recent iPad Pro models\u2014they still aren\u2019t the best for truly enjoying music. A good Bluetooth speaker can address that. We wouldn\u2019t recommend paying a ton here given the inherent compromises with Bluetooth audio: you typically need to pay a premium for something large enough to sound passable, and at that point you might as well buy a Wi-Fi speaker that\u2019ll sound significantly better. But for less than $100, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3481m0Z\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UE Wonderboom 2</a> achieves most of the things you\u2019d want a portable wireless speaker to do well.</p>\n<p>Chief among those: it\u2019s <em>really </em>portable, with a squat candle-like shape that\u2019s just 104mm high and 95.3mm wide. It\u2019s also supremely durable, with an IP67 rating\u2014meaning it\u2019s waterproof and dustproof\u2014and a fabric- and rubber-coated design that floats in water and can withstand drops from five or so feet without any signs of scuffing. A built-in elastic loop makes it easy to clip to a bag or hang from a towel hook. The giant volume buttons and playback controls on top are generally easy to comprehend and operate, though you can only skip tracks forward, not backward. Battery life is fine, if not spectacular, at about 9-10 hours a charge, but the speaker disappointingly charges over microUSB instead of a faster USB-C standard.</p>\n<p>No Bluetooth speaker this small will produce fantastic audio in a vacuum. The Wonderboom 2 doesn\u2019t change that: it can distort at the highest volumes, it loses detail with more complex tracks, and it has just about nothing when it comes to deep sub-bass. But given the context, it plays loud and relatively balanced, with good mids that make vocals nicely clear. You usually won\u2019t hear the whole of a song, but you\u2019ll get enough to make it enjoyable. You can use a second Wonderboom speaker to play in stereo as well. On its own, we found the Wonderboom 2 to sound cleaner than the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Pubptq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anker Soundcore Flare</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Jyh7GI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tribit StormBox</a>, two speakers we\u2019ve recommended in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/guidemaster-the-best-back-to-school-gadgets-to-aid-studying-woes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">past gift guides</a>, so it more than holds its own in the sub-$100 range.</p>\n<p>In all, the Wonderboom 2 is something of an ideal portable Bluetooth speaker: it\u2019s rugged, travel-friendly, easy to use, good-looking, and fun-enough sounding. For the shower, pool parties, or just better personal listening at home, it\u2019s a nifty complement to your iPhone or iPad.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ue-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"UE Wonderboom 2 product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">UE Wonderboom 2                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_23080465\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3481m0Z\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                Buy Now                            </a>\n                                                            <select class=\"ars-link-select ars-link-select-buy-box\" data-target-btn=\"bb_button_23080465\">\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://amzn.to/3481m0Z\">Amazon $79.99</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FUltimate-Ears-WONDER-BOOM-2-Speaker-System%2F208849505%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Walmart $99.99</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-portable-bluetooth-speaker-deep-space%2F6344800.p%3FskuId%3D6344800&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Best Buy $79.99</option>\n                                                                </select>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/3481m0Z\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FUltimate-Ears-WONDER-BOOM-2-Speaker-System%2F208849505%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-portable-bluetooth-speaker-deep-space%2F6344800.p%3FskuId%3D6344800&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>\n<h2>Best Lightning flash drive</h2>\n<h3>SanDisk iXpand</h3>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iXpand1.jpg\"><img alt='SanDisk&#039;s iXpand Lightning flash drive.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iXpand1-640x427.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iXpand1-1280x854.jpg 2x\" alt='SanDisk&#039;s iXpand Lightning flash drive.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/iXpand1.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">SanDisk's iXpand Lightning flash drive.</a> (credit: Valentina Palladino)</p></div>\n<p>Lots of people in my life could use more storage on their iPhones.

Its Lightning connector plugs into your device and, using the iXpand app, lets you choose which content you want to transfer to the drive and erase from your device.</p>\n<p>The iXpand app takes nothing to learn how to use, and you can see the files on the drive and those on your iPhone from directly in the app. I use mine to remove vacation photos from my iPhone so I can transfer them to my PC, and I appreciate that the iXpand drive saves the image as well as a .mov file for those images that were taken as Live Photos. The drive also supports an auto backup feature that will save all your content every time you plug it in. Starting at $59, it\u2019s an affordable way to make your iPhone or iPad feel a bit more like new.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ixpand-300x169.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"SanDisk iXpand product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">SanDisk iXpand                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_39065532\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/31LRysg\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                Buy Now                            </a>\n                                                            <select class=\"ars-link-select ars-link-select-buy-box\" data-target-btn=\"bb_button_39065532\">\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://amzn.to/31LRysg\">Amazon $22.99</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSanDisk-32GB-iXpand-USB-3-0-Lightning-Flash-Drive-for-your-iPhone-and-iPad%2F174300526&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Walmart $23.08</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsandisk-ixpand-32gb-usb-3-0-lightning-flash-drive%2F5061603.p%3FskuId%3D5061603&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Best Buy $27.99</option>\n                                                                </select>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/31LRysg\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSanDisk-32GB-iXpand-USB-3-0-Lightning-Flash-Drive-for-your-iPhone-and-iPad%2F174300526&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsandisk-ixpand-32gb-usb-3-0-lightning-flash-drive%2F5061603.p%3FskuId%3D5061603&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best USB-C flash drive</h2>\n<h3>SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C</h3>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sandiskusbc2.jpg\"><img alt='SanDisk&#039;s Ultra Dual Drive USB-C flash drive.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sandiskusbc2-640x427.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sandiskusbc2-1280x855.jpg 2x\" alt='SanDisk&#039;s Ultra Dual Drive USB-C flash drive.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sandiskusbc2.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">SanDisk's Ultra Dual Drive USB-C flash drive.</a> (credit: Valentina Palladino)</p></div>\n<p>In the same vein as the iXpand is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31HilG3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SanDisk's Ultra Dual Drive</a>, a USB-C flash drive that can help those with USB-C smartphones free up space on their devices. With max 150MB/s read speeds, it's not as fast as some USB-C adapters or hubs, but those devices only serve as bridges between two devices sharing data. SanDisk's drive is handy to have if and when you run out of storage unexpectedly and need to free up space immediately <em>without</em> losing any of your existing data. It's also a convenient sharing device thanks to its retractable design that lets it connect to both USB-C and USB-A devices. As more laptops and smartphones switch to USB-C, SanDisk's dual drive could end up being the only flash drive you need going forward to connect to new and old devices.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sandiskdd-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">SanDisk Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_38052331\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/31HilG3\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                Buy Now                            </a>\n                                                            <select class=\"ars-link-select ars-link-select-buy-box\" data-target-btn=\"bb_button_38052331\">\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://amzn.to/31HilG3\">Amazon $8.97</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsandisk-ultra-32gb-usb-3-1-usb-type-c-flash-drive%2F5219000.p%3FskuId%3D5219000&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Best Buy $11.99</option>\n                                                                </select>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/31HilG3\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsandisk-ultra-32gb-usb-3-1-usb-type-c-flash-drive%2F5219000.p%3FskuId%3D5219000&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best USB-C hub for iPad</h2>\n<h3>OWC Travel Dock</h3>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/owctraveldock1.jpg\"><img alt='The OWC Travel Dock.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/owctraveldock1-640x427.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/owctraveldock1-1280x854.jpg 2x\" alt='The OWC Travel Dock.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/owctraveldock1.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">The OWC Travel Dock.</a> (credit: Valentina Palladino)</p></div>\n<p>The USB-C ports on the newest iPad Pros open the tablets up to a new world of capabilities and accessories, including hubs and docks. While almost any USB-C hub would enhance the versatility of the iPad, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/32HSFu9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OWC's Travel Dock</a> provides the best combination of features, speed, and portability.</p>\n<p>The new hockey-puck-sized hub connects to the iPad (and other USB-C devices) using a built-in cable that hides neatly on its underside when not in use. In our testing, it had solid data transfer speeds that were close to those of docks and hubs that are designed to be stationary on a desk. It has\u00a0one USB-C port for PD pass-through, two USB-A 3.1 Gen 1 ports, one HDMI port, and one SD card reader\u2014ports that should be enough to keep your iPad connected (and charged up) no matter where you are. We wish it had an Ethernet port, but that's a small price to pay for an otherwise solid portable hub that doesn't break the bank at $39.99.</p>\n<p>Apple's own adapters, such as its <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-USB-C-to-USB-Adapter%2F195852567&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USB-C to USB-A adapter</a>, are good alternatives if you only need one specific port or prefer not to have a hub hanging off of your computer.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/owc-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"OWC Travel Dock product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">OWC Travel Dock                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_16869025\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/32HSFu9\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $39.99 from Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best game controller</h2>\n<h3>Microsoft Xbox One Wireless Controller (Model 1708)</h3>\n<h3>Sony DualShock 4</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Xbox-One-Controller-and-DualShock-4.jpg\"><img alt='The Xbox One Wireless Controller and Sony&#039;s DualShock 4 controller.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Xbox-One-Controller-and-DualShock-4-640x435.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Xbox-One-Controller-and-DualShock-4-1280x869.jpg 2x\" alt='The Xbox One Wireless Controller and Sony&#039;s DualShock 4 controller.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Xbox-One-Controller-and-DualShock-4.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Xbox One Wireless Controller and Sony's DualShock 4 controller.</a> (credit: Jeff Dunn)</p></div>With <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/apple-tv-games-will-work-with-ps4-xbox-one-s-controllers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iOS 13 adding formal support</a> for <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-One-Bluetooth-Wireless-Controller-Black-6CL00005%2F111779721&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One Wireless Controller</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-Playstation-4-DualShock-4-Controller-Black%2F55013075&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sony\u2019s DualShock 4</a> gamepad, figuring out the best game controller for the iPhone and iPad has become much simpler: just buy whichever console controller you prefer. If you\u2019ve ever used an Xbox One (or Xbox 360) or PlayStation 4, chances are you already know which design you find more comfortable.</p>\n<p>Personally, despite using the PS4 as my primary console for most of this past generation of consoles, I gravitate toward the Xbox One pad. Its asymmetrical joystick layout feels more natural to my hands, its triggers are springier, and its d-pad is less mushy. It requires AA batteries\u2014unless you pay an extra $20-25 for <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-one-play-charge-kit-black%2F9008298.p%3FskuId%3D9008298&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft\u2019s rechargeable battery kit</a>\u2014but it gets much more battery life per \u201ccharge\u201d than the DualShock 4\u2019s built-in unit, which tends to degrade to a fairly poor level over time. (Investing in a good set of rechargeable AA batteries and a charger is a good idea anyway.) And if you ever want to play games on the PC, the Xbox One pad is easier to set up on Windows, particularly with clients besides Steam.</p>\n<p>That said, the DualShock 4\u2019s joysticks are larger and softer to the touch, and the whole pad is a better fit for smaller hands. Naturally, it\u2019s also better suited for the PS4 Remote Play app. And both are a breeze to pair with an iOS device. It\u2019s really something of a toss-up: if you don\u2019t want to just use whichever controller already came with your chosen console, the right answer is usually whichever is cheaper at the time.</p>\n<p>Either way, there\u2019s some fine print to keep in mind here. iOS games are still meant to be played with your fingers first, and while more and more titles do have controller support\u2014including <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3439826/here-are-all-the-apple-arcade-games-that-can-support-controllers.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many of those</a> included in Apple\u2019s new Arcade service\u2014there\u2019s no guarantee their interfaces will match the icons on your gamepad. One game\u2019s A button may be your controller\u2019s X button. Rumble support and other advanced features may not always work, either. And if you opt for the Xbox One pad, you\u2019ll need to make sure it\u2019s a model 1708 controller, which launched alongside the Xbox One S and includes Bluetooth support. The link below is safe as of this writing, but you can verify you have the right model by checking the label within the battery compartment of your gamepad or by ensuring the surface around the Xbox button isn\u2019t glossy.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content

using <a href=\"https://amzn.to/33VoXSv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pop Sockets</a> on my smartphone cases, but I brush this off every time. While they may be the staple accessory for teens and college kids alike, Pop Sockets are actually great smartphone stands that aren\u2019t stationary. Some will prefer an actual desk accessory that props your smartphone up, but I love the portability of Pop Sockets. Stick one or two to your smartphone case (or to the smartphone itself\u2014don\u2019t worry, you can get them off if you really have to)\u2014and you have a relatively unobtrusive kickstand of sorts that props the smartphone up in landscape mode quite well.</p>\n<p>I regularly use my Pop Socket to make watching videos on my iPhone easier and to make viewing photos, documents, and other things more convenient when I\u2019m on the go. I also use these little popping disks to grip my smartphone more easily, and that comes in handy when I\u2019m taking photos (selfies and regular photos) or when I have a bunch of other things to hold and only have two fingers to grip my smartphone.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/popsocket-300x303.png\"\n                                    alt=\"Pop Socket product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Pop Socket                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_25221810\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/33VoXSv\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                Buy Now                            </a>\n                                                            <select class=\"ars-link-select ars-link-select-buy-box\" data-target-btn=\"bb_button_25221810\">\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://amzn.to/33VoXSv\">Amazon $9.98</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPopSockets-PopGrip-Black%2F269416121&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Walmart $9.97</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpopsockets-popgrip-dove-white-marble%2F6331958.p%3FskuId%3D6331958&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Best Buy $9.99</option>\n                                                                </select>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/33VoXSv\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPopSockets-PopGrip-Black%2F269416121&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fpopsockets-popgrip-dove-white-marble%2F6331958.p%3FskuId%3D6331958&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h3>Tomtoc Play Stand</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Tomtoc-Play-Stand-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The Tomtoc Play Stand.

While Tomtoc technically markets it\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/08/guidemaster-the-best-nintendo-switch-accessories-you-can-buy-in-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">for the Nintendo Switch</a>\u2014and it works great for that purpose\u2014it\u2019s just as useful for an iPhone or iPad mini. Its aluminum frame feels sturdy and substantial, with small rubber grips on the base and \u201clip\u201d that keep an iPhone and the stand itself steadily in place. Since it\u2019s designed to hold a Switch, that lip provides plenty of room for whatever case you may have protecting your device.</p>\n<p>The stand as a whole is highly adjustable, with a couple of freely movable hinges that don\u2019t restrict your device to fixed heights and angles. It can fold it up flat, making it particularly easy to stash in a bag or purse, and a hole in the back lets you run a charging cable to your device without having to take it off the stand. It's going for $12 as of this writing, which is good value.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tomtoc-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"Tomtoc Play Stand product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Tomtoc Play Stand                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_39069457\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2WjwOGU\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $11.99 from Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h3>Stump Stand</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Stump-Stand-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The Stump Stand.

This little chunk of silicone isn\u2019t as portable or adjustable as our other picks, but its weighted base and grippy bottom keep it stuck in place\u2014and keep your device from shaking heavily when you need to use it. It only allows for three viewing angles\u2014almost straight up, almost down flat, and one angle in between\u2014and it\u2019s somewhat heavy at 9.5 ounces, but the design is far from oversized and keeps a low profile. If your iPhone or iPad still has a Home button, there\u2019s also a small cutout for pressing that without having to pick up your device. The $25 asking price is a bit high, but for a stand that\u2019ll keep your iPad reliably in place without eating up too much desk space, it\u2019s a good buy.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/stumpstand-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"Stump Stand product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Stump Stand                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_37202055\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2C1Bk3P\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                $24.95 from Amazon                            </a>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best iPhone cases</h2>\n<h3>Speck Presidio Pro</h3>\n<h3>Otterbox Commuter</h3>\n<p>I never have a naked smartphone because I want my most used device to be protected at all times. While you can find affordable iPhone cases almost anywhere you go, there's something to be said for spending a bit more on a case if you value protection over fashion.</p>\n<p>Two of my favorites are the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/348AZYP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Speck Presidio Pro</a> case and the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PrSGPg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Otterbox Commuter</a> case, and I use them both for different reasons. Speck's Presidio Pro is more of an everyday case because it's a great combination of protection and fashion\u2014it protects your iPhone from drops up to 10 feet, and its soft matte finish is more luxurious than that of a flimsy, plastic case.</p>\n<p>I break out the Otterbox Commuter case when I'm going on a day trip or a full vacation. Whether I'm hiking in a national park or hoofing it around an unfamiliar city, the Commuter case gives my iPhone extra drop protection, and I like the added Lightning cover that prevents dust from getting inside the charging port. It's bulkier than the Presidio Pro, but the extra protection is worth the added heft in those particular situations. It's also quite easy to get my iPhone in and out of the Commuter case thanks to its double-layer design.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div

The newest version of DJI\u2019s gimbal makes smartphone photography and videography easier with a plethora of features, but it\u2019s even better now because it\u2019s foldable. It may still be an awkwardly shaped accessory (both when in use and when folded), but now it won\u2019t take up nearly as much space in your bag as previous models did.</p>\n<p>The Osmo Mobile 3 has all the same features that the Osmo Mobile 2 did, including gesture control, active track, and now improved on-device controls (there\u2019s a grand total of five buttons on the handle). It also has a USB port so you can charge your smartphone while you\u2019re using it in the gimbal.

Its design mimics a real pencil or pen (just a slightly longer one), and there\u2019s little to no latency when using it to write on an iPad\u2019s screen. Pressure sensitivity lets you create thinner or thicker lines depending on how hard you press, and the Pencil pairs wirelessly and automatically when it snaps magnetically to your iPad\u2019s edges. The second-gen Pencil charges wirelessly as well.</p>\n<p>Like most of Apple\u2019s accessories, the Pencil is the best stylus option for the iPad because it was designed specifically to work with iPadOS. But it is on the expensive side ($129 for the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/2018-ipad-pro-review-whats-a-computer/3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">second-gen</a> and $99 for the first-gen), leaving room for the $54 Logitech Crayon to be a good, affordable alternative. It\u2019s not pressure sensitive like the Apple Pencil, and it has a chunkier design, but it\u2019s nearly as good in terms of latency and is less of a hassle to charge than the first-gen Apple Pencil, thanks to its built-in Lightning port.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/applepencil2-300x300.jpg\"\n                                    alt=\"Apple Pencil (2nd gen) product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Apple Pencil (2nd gen)                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_79311018\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/361526w\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                Buy Now                            </a>\n                                                            <select class=\"ars-link-select ars-link-select-buy-box\" data-target-btn=\"bb_button_79311018\">\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://amzn.to/361526w\">Amazon $120</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation%2F949679706&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Walmart $120</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-apple-pencil-2nd-generation%2F6252354.p%3FskuId%3D6252354&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Best Buy $120.99</option>\n                                                                </select>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/361526w\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Pencil-2nd-Generation%2F949679706&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-apple-pencil-2nd-generation%2F6252354.p%3FskuId%3D6252354&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<h2>Best iPad keyboard case</h2>\n<h3>Apple Smart Keyboard</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Apple-Smart-Keyboard-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Apple's Smart Keyboard with a 10.5-inch iPad Air.

You\u2019ll need an external keyboard to make that work, though. If you\u2019d prefer that keyboard to double as an iPad case, Apple\u2019s own <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Smart-Keyboard-for-iPad-7th-Generation-and-iPad-Air-3rd-Generation-US-English%2F502019273&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart Keyboard</a> (for the 3<sup>rd</sup>-gen iPad Air and 7<sup>th</sup>-gen iPad) and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Smart-Keyboard-Folio-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-3rd-Generation-US-English%2F857650547&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Smart Keyboard Folio</a> (for the latest iPad Pros) are your best bets. (We dismissed iPad mini keyboard cases here as they\u2019re too cramped to use comfortably.)</p>\n<p>The big draw here is that these keyboards are two of the only devices that make use of Apple\u2019s Smart Connector, which requires no Bluetooth pairing process or battery management. You snap them to the iPad and everything just works. Each device is lightweight and adds little bulk to an iPad, while the fabric-coated keys are water-resistant and easy to keep clean of gunk, since there are no crevices or openings on the boards to begin with. When you\u2019re not typing, the keyboards serve as handy iPad stands, though the standard Smart Keyboard only lets you position your iPad at one angle, whereas the Folio supports two.</p>\n<p>Actually typing with the Smart Keyboard isn\u2019t what we\u2019d call a revelation, but it\u2019s fine. This is a far cry from a Lenovo ThinkPad, borrowing more from the super low travel of recent MacBook keyboards instead. Slamming on them for several hours straight could get fatiguing, and there's no backlight whatsoever. But the keys are raised and spaced out well enough to avoid mistakes, the low travel makes them relatively fast to use, and that fabric coating does have a nice, smooth feel.</p>\n<p>Both Smart Keyboards are priced higher than we\u2019d like, and the lack of a rear cover on the 7<sup>th</sup>-gen iPad and 3<sup>rd</sup>-gen iPad Air model is something Apple probably should have addressed by now.

Given that it weighs roughly two pounds and includes a number pad, it\u2019s not the easiest thing to take on the road. But at 158mm\u00d7380mm\u00d722mm, it\u2019s still smaller than most full-size keyboards, and that weight helps it stay nice and steady on a desk or table. A built-in device cradle also makes it easy to stash an iPad right in front of you while you work. Its rounded keys may feel peculiar at first, but they\u2019re distinguished and largely satisfying to type on\u2014not as deep or tactile as a good mechanical keyboard, but quiet and comfortable for a wireless multi-device option.</p>\n<p>That multi-device aspect means the K780 can pair with up to three devices at once, either via Bluetooth or a USB-A dongle. A trio of buttons at the top of the keyboard let you quickly switch between profiles, so you can easily jump from typing on an iPhone to an iPad to a Mac. Logitech rates its battery life at two years through a pre-installed pair of AAA batteries; we\u2019ve yet to require a new set after more than a year of use.</p>\n<p>The downsides here aren\u2019t insignificant: there\u2019s no backlighting, and while the shrunken arrow keys help reduce the K780\u2019s overall footprint, they can be a pain to use. But for $60 or so, it\u2019s a good value for a dedicated keyboard that lends itself well to working on an iOS device. If you don\u2019t think the device stand or number pad are worth it, though, Logitech sells a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2MVnOF1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smaller model called the K380</a> that has a similar key feel and costs $30-40.</p>\n    <div class=\"ars-component-layout ars-component-buy-box align-wide\">\n        <div class=\"ars-logo-box\">\n            <div class=\"ars-logo-box-content ars-logo-box-content-buy-box\">\n                <div class=\"ars-buy-box\">\n                    <div class=\"ars-buy-box-content\">\n                                                <div class=\"ars-circle-image ars-circle-image-green ars-circle-image-buy-box\">\n                            <div class=\"ars-circle-image-container ars-buy-box-image-container\">\n                                                                <img \n                                    src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/k780-300x300.jpeg\"\n                                    alt=\"Logitech K780 product image\"\n                                    class=\"ars-circle-image-img ars-buy-box-image\"\n                                >\n                                                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                                                <h3 class=\"ars-buy-box-title\">Logitech K780                                                </h3>\n                        <div class=\"ars-buy-box-button-container\">\n                            <a id=\"bb_button_37970377\" class=\"button button-large button-orange ars-buy-box-button\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2BR4x12\" target=\"_blank\">\n                                Buy Now                            </a>\n                                                            <select class=\"ars-link-select ars-link-select-buy-box\" data-target-btn=\"bb_button_37970377\">\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://amzn.to/2BR4x12\">Amazon $56.10</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-K780-Multi-Device-Wireless-Keyboard%2F178820743&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Walmart $56.10</option>\n                                                                    <option value=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-k780-wireless-keyboard-white%2F5592420.p%3FskuId%3D5592420&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\">Best Buy $59.99</option>\n                                                                </select>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://amzn.to/2BR4x12\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLogitech-K780-Multi-Device-Wireless-Keyboard%2F178820743&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                <a style=\"display:none;\" href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flogitech-k780-wireless-keyboard-white%2F5592420.p%3FskuId%3D5592420&amp;subid1=iOSAccessoriesGM\"></a>\n                                                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"ars-component ars-component-affiliate-disclaimer\">\n            <div class=\"ars-affiliate-disclaimer-message\">(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1587051&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"

Vue? Not so much. (credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/xsix/4961956583/\">xsix / Flickr</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>Sony today <a href=\"https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/10/29/sony-interactive-entertainment-to-shut-down-playstation-vue/\">announced</a> that it will soon shut down PlayStation Vue, its streaming TV service that served as a lighter alternative to traditional cable for live-TV viewers. The company's short blog post on the subject says that Vue will continue to operate until January 30, 2020, but that it will become inoperable after that date.</p>\n<p>\"Unfortunately, the highly competitive Pay TV industry, with expensive content and network deals, has been slower to change than we expected,\" Sony wrote. \"Because of this, we have decided to remain focused on our core gaming business.\"</p>\n<p>Sony will continue to offer movies and TV episodes for purchase on-demand through the PlayStation Store, however; this closure only affects the live-TV service, which licensed channels traditionally found on cable for streaming in an interface that was available on PlayStation game consoles, Roku, Apple TV, and other platforms.</p>\n<p>PlayStation Vue was the first major service of its type when it launched in the United States in 2015. It was followed by offerings from Hulu, YouTube, and others that sought to provide the basic live-TV cable experience streaming over the Internet with more modern interfaces and built-in features like cloud-based DVR and without long-term contract commitments. However, despite its early start, the Vue service lagged competitors in terms of subscribers. And since Sony had less leverage in the entertainment business than say, Disney (which is the majority owner of Hulu), it reportedly found itself paying more than competitors for already extremely pricy content deals with TV networks.</p>\n<p>Just a few days ago, a report claimed that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/sony-seeks-to-bail-from-streaming-tv-business-by-selling-off-playstation-vue/\">Sony had sought to find a buyer for the Vue service</a>, which has never been profitable. Any buyer would have acquired Vue's subscribers and technology but not necessarily its content agreements, which are difficult to secure. The report indicated that Sony was struggling to find an interested party.</p>\n<p>The effort to reimagine the cable bundle for streaming devices has been slow to gain traction even for some of the other top players that have outperformed Vue. As we noted in our previous article on the company's efforts to sell Vue, the wind seems to be strongly behind a channel-based, a la carte ecosystem of low-priced ($6-15/month) streaming services dedicated primarily to producing and distributing original content rather than licensing entire channels or big content packages from other companies.</p>\n<p>Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Showtime, CBS, and others have already found varying levels of success with the strategy, and major new competitors like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/we-now-know-what-disney-will-look-like-plus-a-few-new-exclusive-series/\">Disney</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/nbc-peacock-adds-to-streaming-glut-next-april-with-15000-hours-of-shows/\">Comcast/NBC Universal</a> are poised to enter the field soon, as well. Cable subscriptions are also declining, albeit slowly; consumers seem to be voting with their dollars for a different model than traditional live-TV bundles, and Sony seems to have learned that the hard way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593445&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>"
