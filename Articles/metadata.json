The Dealmaster is back with another round of discounts and price drops. Today's list is headlined by a deal on the 128GB variant of Apple's 6th-gen iPad, which is\u00a0<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-6th-Gen-128GB-Wi-Fi%2F955898738%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;subid1=dealmaster102919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">down to $299 at Walmart</a>\u00a0as of this writing. That matches the price we saw during <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/dealmaster-all-the-best-amazon-prime-day-2019-tech-deals-we-can-find/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon's Prime Day event</a>, and this price tag comes in about $30 below the typical price we've seen whenever the tablet has\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2019/08/dealmaster-ipads-pixel-phones-routers-and-more-in-todays-top-tech-deals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">been discounted</a> in the past year.</p>\n<p>The big caveat here is that Apple recently replaced this iPad with <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-Latest-Model-Wi-Fi-32GB%2F216119597&amp;subid1=dealmaster103119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a new model</a>, which starts at $329 for a 32GB model. That 7th-gen iPad bumps up the screen size from 9.7 inches to 10.2 inches and adds support for Apple's Smart Connector port, meaning it can use Apple's Smart Keyboard accessory instead of solely relying on Bluetooth keyboards. It also bumps up the RAM from 2GB to 3GB.</p>\n<p>Other than that, though, this older model <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/mini-review-the-2019-ipad-has-a-new-skin-but-its-mostly-the-same-tablet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">performs almost identically</a> to the new one. It <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/04/2018-ipad-review-content-creation-with-compromises/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">has the same A10 processor</a>, the same camera and battery specs, the same Lightning port and 3.5mm headphone jack, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/ipados-review-the-ipad-is-dead-long-live-the-ipad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">same iPadOS software</a>. It's also saddled with the same non-laminated display and relatively dated design. Springing more for <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F10-5-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold%2F803550045%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;subid1=dealmaster103119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an iPad Air</a> (or a <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad%2Fipad-pro-10-5&amp;subid1=dealmaster103119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refurbished 10.5-inch iPad Pro</a>) will bring you a noticeable hardware upgrade, the 10.2-inch iPad may grant you an extra year of iPadOS support down the road, and it's always possible Black Friday will bring prices down further. But if you just want an affordable iPad and value the extra storage, this is a good value.</p>\n<p>If you're all set on the tablet front, though, we also have deals on Amazon's Echo Dot, the Apple Watch Series 3, USB-C PD wall chargers, and more.

An increase in people walking in low-light conditions makes Halloween the most <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/forget-poisoned-candy-and-razor-blades-heres-the-real-halloween-horror/\">dangerous night of the year</a> for pedestrians.</p>\n<p>Pedestrian deaths are on the rise overall, as cars become safer for drivers <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20927512/traffic-death-crash-statistics-nhtsa-us-2018\">but more dangerous for everyone else</a>. Sophisticated pedestrian detection systems, which are becoming more common in cars, aren't doing particularly well. Some of them score <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/six-cars-that-could-prevent-you-from-hitting-a-pedestrian/\">highly on easier tests</a> in broad daylight, but they do\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/aaa-finds-your-new-car-probably-wont-stop-you-from-hitting-pedestrians/\">not fare so well</a> in more difficult conditions like low light.</p>\n<p>When a driver shares the blame for a pedestrian death with an automated car, how do people assign blame? A study in Nature Human Behaviour this week suggests that people may focus their ire on the human in a shared-control situation. The authors argue that this could result in an under-regulation of the safety of shared-control vehicles.</p>\n<h2>Shared responsibility?</h2>\n<p>Although the broad availability of fully autonomous cars lurks <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/uber-tesla-and-waymo-all-struggled-with-self-driving-in-2018/\">over the horizon</a>, a range of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS)\u2014from intervention during emergency maneuvers to Tesla's Autopilot suite\u2014offload some of the responsibility for safety from the driver to the car.</p>\n<p>\"We are entering a delicate era of shared control between humans and machines,\" write researcher Edmond Awad and his colleagues. Understanding how people respond to the moral implications of this situation is crucial for everything from calculating the expected liability for manufacturers, to anticipating how the legal system should react to deaths in situations of shared control between driver and car.</p>\n<p>How the people who set these policies will react is anyone's guess. Based on press coverage of a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/09/ntsb-teslas-autopilot-ux-a-major-role-in-fatal-model-s-crash/\">2016 Tesla Autopilot death</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/03/arizona-prosecutor-wont-charge-uber-for-2018-self-driving-death/\">killing of a pedestrian by an Uber self-driving car</a>, it seems that people might be more inclined to heap blame heavily on the human drivers and less on the cars, Awad and his colleagues suggest. \"Was this pattern a fluke of the circumstances of the crash and press environment?\" they ask. \"Or does it reflect something psychologically deeper that may colour our responses to human-machine joint action and, in particular, when a human-machine pair jointly controls a vehicle?\"</p>\n<h2>Bad call vs negligence</h2>\n<p>To test this, Awad and colleagues constructed a series of vignettes that described a shared-control car killing a pedestrian. These vignettes described a range of sole- or dual-driver car options, ranging from a sole human driver to a fully automated car (referred to in the vignettes as a \"machine driver\").</p>\n<p>In between were dual-driver options with a primary human driver and a secondary machine driver (much like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/toyota-is-betting-fully-driverless-cars-are-still-years-away/\">Toyota's Guardian</a>) or a primary machine driver and secondary human driver (like Tesla's Autopilot). There were also options for human-human pairings\u2014like dual-control cars for people learning to drive\u2014and machine-machine pairings.</p>\n<p>The researchers explored how people apportioned blame in these setups. First, each person read a description of one of the different driver combinations\u2014so each participant only ever had to think about one type of human-machine jointly driven car. Then, they read about two different crash scenarios, both of which described driver error leading to the death of a pedestrian. But the two scenarios differed in whether both drivers made an error or only one of them.</p>\n<p>In \"bad intervention\" scenarios, the main driver (either human or machine) makes a driving decision that would avoid hitting the pedestrian, but the secondary driver intervenes with the wrong call, resulting in a collision. In bad interventions, it makes sense that the secondary driver is really the one to blame, since they overrode the correct actions of the primary driver.</p>\n<p>This expectation matches how people reacted. When participants saw this scenario and rated how blameworthy each driver was and how much they caused the death, on a scale of 1 to 100, the secondary driver came out bearing most of the blame. This was true whether or not the secondary driver was a human or machine.</p>\n<p>In \"missed intervention\" scenarios, though, things looked a little different. In these scenarios, the main driver is the one who makes the wrong call, but the secondary driver doesn't intervene to rescue the situation. In these scenarios, both drivers made an error.</p>\n<p>Participants did apportion some blame to both drivers in these scenarios\u2014but the human took more blame than the car. This was true when the human had made the initial error and the car had failed to correct it\u2014and it was also true when the car made the error and the human failed to correct. That suggests that participants weren't assigning blame based on whether the driver had made a wrong call or just not intervened; rather, they were assigning blame based on the type of driver.</p>\n<p>These results replicated across different studies, including a replication that used a different participant sample and two that tweaked the presentation of the vignettes to make them look more like newspaper articles.</p>\n<h2>Under-reacting to the dangers</h2>\n<p>The results might be intuitive, but science is about checking whether intuitions are supported by actual data. People seem to understand that self-driving cars have pretty hard limitations on dealing flexibly with a range of scenarios and that the more flexible driver\u2014the human\u2014should be trying to compensate for that.</p>\n<p>The study isn't the final word. For one thing, participants knew they weren't reading real stories, which could have affected their answers\u2014but the responses do match the public reactions to the Tesla and Uber crashes, the authors note. \"While there may be many psychological barriers to self-driving car adoption,\" they write, \"public over-reaction to dual-error cases is not likely to be one of them.\"</p>\n<p>Instead, the researchers argue, there might be a risk of <em>under-reaction</em>. If regulation of self-driving cars is based on public pressure and juries' decisions, car manufacturers might be absolved of blame pretty easily. And that might reduce the pressure for manufacturers to improve their systems.</p>\n<p>There's a historical analogue for this, write Awad and his co-authors: people used to ignore car manufacturers' liability when car occupants were hurt in collisions, because they attributed the collisions to driver error. \"Top-down regulation was necessary to introduce the concept of 'crash worthiness' into the legal system,\" they note. Similarly, they argue, self-driving car safety might need top-down safety regulations.</p>\n<p><em>Nature Human Behaviour</em>, 2018.

The decision, known as <em>CLS Bank v. Alice</em>, has had a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/features/2018/06/why-the-supreme-courts-software-patent-ban-didnt-last/\">big impact</a> over the last five years, invalidating a lot of broad software patents.</p>\n<p>But a <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txed.182805/gov.uscourts.txed.182805.283.0.pdf\">ruling this week</a> illustrates the limits of that landmark ruling. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USAA\">confusingly named</a> United Services Automobile Association, which provides insurance and other financial products, sued Wells Fargo for infringing two patents on the concept of cashing checks with a mobile device. Wells Fargo argued that the patents were abstract\u2014and therefore invalid\u2014under the <em>Alice</em> rule.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, a <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txed.182805/gov.uscourts.txed.182805.283.0.pdf\">Texas federal judge disagreed</a>, upholding the patents and allowing the case to move forward to trial.</p>\n<h2>Computers are more precise than humans</h2>\n<p>The patents cover check-cashing mobile apps that automatically snap a photo once a suitable image of the check is in the field of view.</p>\n<p>A key claim of <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US8977571B1/en\">one of the USAA patents</a> covers the concept of using a \"processor\" (aka a smartphone) to take a picture of a check and then send the check over a \"communication pathway\" (aka a network). USAA's supposed invention is the idea of monitoring \"an image of the check in a field of view of a camera of a mobile device with respect to a monitoring criterion using an image monitoring and capture module of the mobile device\"\u2014and waiting until the image has met the criteria (is the entire check in the frame? Is there adequate light?) before snapping the picture. In other words, they patented the idea that you should wait until you have a good shot before snapping a picture.</p>\n\n<p>The patent isn't limited to any particular \"monitoring criteria.\" Any app that automatically takes an image when a check is in the field of view would likely infringe USAA's patent.</p>\n<p>Wells Fargo argued that USAA had simply used a computer to perform the same steps any human being would take when snapping a photo of a check. Obviously if a human being was snapping a picture of a check, they would monitor the image in the viewfinder and only click the button once it showed an acceptable image.</p>\n<p>But the court disagreed, noting that human eyes and human brains can't measure objective criteria like brightness as precisely as a computer can. USAA has argued that its approach leads to fewer bad check images being submitted. So in the court's view, the patent doesn't just cover an old-fashioned process being done on a computer\u2014the use of the computer improves the process, yielding a patentable invention.</p>\n<h2>The case is far from over</h2>\n<p>The court's conclusion here is a bit of a head-scratcher. Obviously computers can perform many tasks faster and more precisely than a human being\u2014that's why people use them. But if this fact were all it took to make \"do it on a computer\" inventions patentable, the <em>Alice</em> precedent would be a dead letter.</p>\n<p>After all, the patent in the original <em>Alice</em> case claimed the concept of using a computer to perform certain types of financial transactions. The court invalidated the patents because they were simply computerizing existing financial techniques. But it's surely true that computers can perform these financial transactions faster and with fewer errors than human traders can. That fact didn't save those patents, and it's not clear why it should help USAA here.</p>\n\n<p>One factor that may have influenced the judge's thinking is the fact that framing a shot of a check is not an explicitly mathematical operation the way the financial transactions in Alice were. Under the hood, of course, everything a computer does is mathematical. But a human framing a photograph doesn't take explicitly numerical measurements. Perhaps this makes the gap between the human and automated processes seem larger for picture-taking than for financial transactions.</p>\n<p>The ruling in the USAA case came from the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/08/why-patent-trolls-go-to-east-texas-explained/\">notoriously patent-friendly</a> Eastern District of Texas, so it's not that surprising that the ruling favored the patent holder. But the case is far from over. The case will now move forward toward trial, where Wells Fargo can raise other objections\u2014perhaps including an argument that the USAA patents are obvious.</p>\n<p>If Wells Fargo loses at trial,\u00a0it will have an opportunity to appeal the ruling to an appeals court. Then either party could ask the Supreme Court to hear the case\u2014though the nation's highest court agrees to hear only a tiny fraction of patent cases.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594331&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Alfa Romeo, Citro\u00ebn, Chrysler, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, Ram, and Vauxhall will all now share a single corporate parent and merge operations. In a press release, Fiat Chrysler and PSA said that the 50:50 merger should save more than $4 billion (\u20ac3.7 billion) a year from \"run-rate synergies without any plant closures.\"</p>\n<p>Merging with another large automaker has been FCA's plan for a while. Before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/07/sergio-marchionne-the-man-who-saved-fiat-chyrsler-dies-at-66/\">his untimely death</a>, Sergio Marchionne had conducted talks with many potential suitors, and earlier this year FCA was in active discussions with Renault. But those talks ultimately went nowhere, and now FCA will join up with France's other big automaker, PSA Group.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, the merger makes a lot of sense. FCA has strong sales in the Americas and a decent portfolio of luxury brands and SUVs and trucks. PSA is strong in Europe, and its brands are better mainstream cars built using more modern architectures. PSA Group is also well ahead of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/06/10-new-hybrid-and-electric-jeeps-by-2022-in-fiat-chryslers-five-year-plan/\">FCA in terms of electrification</a>.</p>\n<p>The new company, which has yet to be named, will be registered in the Netherlands, although it will \"continue to maintain significant presences in the current operating head-office locations in France, Italy, and the US.\" PSA Group boss Carlos Tavares will be CEO of the 11-person board, with FCA's John Elkann as chair.</p>\n<p>Based on 2018's results, the new company would have 8.7 million sales, combined revenues of $190 billion (\u20ac170 billion), and $12.3 billion in profit. However, from next year those profits are at risk from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lovecarindustry/status/1113409912321847296\">massive European Union fines</a> that await any OEM unable to get its fleet-wide emissions below 95g CO<sub>2</sub>/km. Earlier this year, we learned that FCA had entered into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/tesla-sells-european-emissions-law-lifeline-to-fiat-chrysler/\">an agreement with Tesla</a>, where it would pay the US automaker \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars in order to count the American EVs as part of its European fleet.</p>\n<p>But the new merged automaker will have a much larger pool of vehicles to take into account, as well as access to in-house BEVs that could be badge-engineered and sold at a profit. Perhaps the biggest loser in this merger could be Tesla, where a profitable quarter <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/10/tesla-made-a-profit-of-143-million-in-q3-2019-on-record-deliveries/\">still depends on emissions credits</a>, not selling cars.</p>\n<p>As for US car buyers, it's probably a little too soon to know what this will mean in terms of the cars we might be able to buy. PSA Group has wanted to return to the US market for a while, and in February news broke that Peugeot would lead that charge. But currently the company's sole US presence is a car-sharing service called Free2Move that operates in Washington, DC. I'd like to think modern American car buyers will take to quirky French crossovers with more enthusiasm than that which greeted a resurgent Alfa Romeo.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594365&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Keeping track of all the different limits on AT&amp;T's unlimited mobile plans is just as difficult as ever, but there's some good news for customers who use lots of smartphone data.</p>\n<p>Buying AT&amp;T's cheapest unlimited plan still comes with the risk of getting your data throttled to speeds slower than those provided to other customers when the network is congested. The possible throttling can be imposed at any time, even if a customer hasn't used much data that month. But while upgrading to pricier plans currently only gives AT&amp;T customers 22GB a month before possible throttling, the plans coming out soon have options for at least 50GB or 100GB of un-throttled use.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T's <a href=\"https://www.att.com/plans/unlimited-data-plans.html\">current</a> entry-level plan is called \"Unlimited &amp; More.\" It costs $70 per month for one line (not including taxes and fees), with the per-line prices descending with each additional line you buy. Each line costs $40 a month if you buy four lines.</p>\n<p>It comes with a big restriction. \"On AT&amp;T Unlimited &amp; More, for all data usage, customer[s] may temporarily experience reduced speeds on these line(s) during times of network congestion,\" AT&amp;T says. Customers aren't throttled to the same speed each time. Instead, these customers get slower speeds than customers who bought other plans when they're in a congested network area. Speeds are returned to normal if the network congestion clears up or if the customer moves to an un-congested location.</p>\n<p>The Unlimited &amp; More plan also only includes SD video quality as video streams are throttled to 1.5Mbps, and mobile-hotspot usage is not allowed.</p>\n<p>Starting November 3, AT&amp;T will offer a new \"Unlimited Starter\" plan as the entry-level edition at prices of $65 per month for a single line or $35 for each line when you buy four lines.</p>\n<p>\"You'll get unlimited calls, texts, and data, with the catch that AT&amp;T can throttle you whenever it decides that the network is too congested,\" The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20940295/att-unlimited-plans-update-starter-extra-elite-data-mobile-cell-hbo-free-streaming\">reported</a> yesterday. \"Unlike the other plans, there's no guaranteed pool of data before deprioritizing starts. You're also limited to SD-quality video, and there's no option to share your Internet by using your phone as a mobile hotspot.\"</p>\n<p>The throttling details weren't mentioned in <a href=\"https://about.att.com/story/2019/new_unlimited_plans.html\">AT&amp;T's press release</a>, but AT&amp;T confirmed to Ars that the above details are correct.</p>\n<h2>New premium options</h2>\n<p>If you want mobile-hotspot usage, HD video streaming, and a guaranteed amount of data before you can be throttled, you have to pay more. With the current \"Unlimited &amp; More Premium\" plan that will soon be replaced, data can be throttled after you use 22GB in a month. This plan costs $80 per month for a single line and $48 per line if you buy four lines. The plan allows 15GB of high-speed mobile-hotspot use and HD streaming in 1080p.</p>\n<p>Going forward, there will be two premium options instead. AT&amp;T Unlimited Extra, available November 3, will be $75 a month for a single line or $40 per line with four lines. The plan includes at least 50GB of data per month before you can be throttled during times of congestion, as well as 15GB of high-speed mobile-hotspot data. However, video is limited to SD.</p>\n<p>The new top-level plan is Unlimited Elite, and AT&amp;T said it will launch \"in the coming weeks\" but did not reveal a specific release date. This one is $85 a month for a single line or $50 per line with four lines, and it comes with 100GB of data before any potential throttling. Unlimited Elite also has 30GB of high-speed mobile-hotspot data and HD-quality streaming video.</p>\n<p>There are also changes in which video services come bundled with unlimited plans. Both of AT&amp;T's current unlimited plans come with AT&amp;T's WatchTV service, which has 35 channels of live TV. Unlimited &amp; More Premium also lets customers choose one of the following services: HBO, Cinemax, Showtime, Starz, Pandora Premium, Spotify Premium, and VRV.</p>\n<p>The new unlimited plans will not include WatchTV and will not give customers a choice of entertainment services. However, Unlimited Elite will include HBO and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/hbo-max-will-bring-up-the-streaming-video-rear-in-may-2020-for-15mo/\">HBO Max</a> when it is released in May 2020.</p>\n<h2>AT&amp;T settlement with FTC is pending</h2>\n<p>AT&amp;T's throttling of unlimited data plans used to be a lot more restrictive. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/att-finally-ramps-down-throttling-of-unlimited-lte-customers/\">Until a change in 2015</a>, AT&amp;T customers who used 5GB of LTE data in a single monthly billing period were throttled for the rest of the month at all times, regardless of whether they were in a congested network area.</p>\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/10/us-sues-att-alleges-severe-throttling-of-unlimited-data-customers/\">sued AT&amp;T in October 2014</a>, saying it misled consumers by promising unlimited data while imposing draconian throttling policies. The FTC and AT&amp;T recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-att-ftc-data/ftc-att-settle-2014-lawsuit-over-data-slowdowns-court-idUSKCN1VE01J\">reached a tentative settlement</a>, but details of the deal haven't been made public yet. AT&amp;T is also facing a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/03/sorry-att-judge-says-throttled-customers-can-pursue-class-action/\">class-action lawsuit</a> over the practice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594349&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Once in place, Messagetap monitors the network for messages containing either a preset list of phone or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity\">IMSI</a> numbers or a preset list of keywords.</p>\n<p>Messages that meet the criteria are then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or\">XOR</a> encoded and saved for harvesting later. FireEye said it found the malware infecting an undisclosed telecom provider. The company researchers said the malware is loaded by an installation script but didn\u2019t otherwise explain how infections take place.</p>\n<h2>Targeting upstream data sources</h2>\n<p>The security firm said Messagetap belongs to APT41, one of several advanced persistent threat hacking groups that researchers say is sponsored by the Chinese government. The group is apparently using the malware to spy on high-ranking military and government officials. In a <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/messagetap-who-is-reading-your-text-messages.html\">report</a>, the researchers said the malware allows China\u2019s intelligence services to obtain a wide range of sensitive data at scale.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe use of MESSAGETAP and targeting of sensitive text messages and call detail records at scale is representative of the evolving nature of Chinese cyber espionage campaigns observed by FireEye,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cAPT41 and multiple other threat groups attributed to Chinese state-sponsored actors have increased their targeting of upstream data entities since 2017. These organizations, located multiple layers above end-users, occupy critical information junctures in which data from multitudes of sources converge into single or concentrated nodes.\u201d</p>\n<p>Messagetap\u2019s 64-bit Linux executable contains two configuration files. The first,\u00a0<code>parm.txt</code>, contains lists of IMSI numbers and phone numbers of interest while <code>keyword_parm.txt</code> lists keywords. Both files are deleted from disk once loaded into memory. After that, Messagetap monitors all traffic passing over the network and looks for messages that match the criteria from the configuration text files. Messages sent to or from the phone or IMSI numbers are collected. Messages containing the keywords are also gathered. The malware parses all traffic at the Ethernet and IP layers and continues parsing protocol layers including SCTP, SCCP, and TCAP.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png\"><img alt='An overview of Messagetap.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview-640x398.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png 2x\" alt='An overview of Messagetap.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/messagetap-overview.png\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">An overview of Messagetap.</a> (credit: FireEye)</p></div>\n<p>Researchers recovered the contents of the configuration files and found a \u201chigh volume of phone numbers and IMSI numbers.\u201d Thursday\u2019s report continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The inclusion of both phone and IMSI numbers show the highly targeted nature of this cyber intrusion. If an SMS message contained either a phone number or an IMSI number that matched the predefined list, it was saved to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor. The targeted phone numbers and IMSI numbers belonged to foreign high-ranking individuals of interest to the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the keyword list contained items of geopolitical interest for Chinese intelligence collection. Sanitized examples include the names of political leaders, military and intelligence organizations and political movements at odds with the Chinese government. If any SMS messages contained these keywords, MESSAGETAP would save the SMS message to a CSV file for later theft by the threat actor.</p>\n<p>In addition to MESSAGETAP SMS theft, Mandiant also identified the threat actor interacting with call detail record (CDR) databases to query, save and steal records for specific individuals during this same intrusion. Targeting CDR information provides a high-level overview of phone calls between individuals, including time, duration, and phone numbers. In contrast, MESSAGETAP captures the contents of specific text messages.</p></blockquote>\n<p>While Messagetap isn\u2019t likely to have monitored the vast majority of the infected telecom\u2019s users, its existence shows that network providers aren\u2019t the only entities that can tap phone networks. Its use demonstrates the prudence of not using phone networks to relay sensitive information unencrypted. The <a href=\"https://signal.org/download/\">Signal</a> messenger remains the best way to send encrypted texts between two phones.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594265&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Currently, all 10nm parts are produced in two of the company's plants: Hillsboro, Oregon, and Kiryat Gat, Israel.

Since 1991, the iconic \"Intel Inside\" logo has referred to the CPU in your computer, but the company sees more potential in investments in storage, software, networking, AI, and the data center.</p>\n<p>This certainly doesn't mean Intel plans to exit the consumer and server CPU business, but it does herald a large shift in the company's overall focus. The company estimates the TAM\u2014Total Addressable Market, or the maximum revenue if literally every potential customer bought an Intel product\u2014of its traditional PC and server CPU line at $52 billion. However, it sees an additional $220 billion TAM potential in what it calls \"Data-centric\" products in data center, Internet of Things, and networking market segments.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/redefining-intel-inside-980x555.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Intel wants to shift much of its focus away from the CPU and onto what it's dubbing the \"XPU\"\u2014a term it's pushing which includes GPUs, FPGAs, and other more specialized processors.

The slide that really drives this commitment home comes from Q2's investor meeting that explicitly shows the company moving from a \"protect and defend\" strategy to a growth strategy. If this slide were in a sales meeting, it wouldn't say much\u2014but delivered to the company's investors, it gains a bit of gravitas.</p>\n<p>Most of this was revealed nearly six months ago at the company's May 2019 investor's meeting, but the Q3 investor's meeting last week continues with and strengthens this story for Intel's future growth, with slides more focused on Optane, network, and IoT/Edge market growth than with the traditional PC and server market.</p>\n<p>The company shows its new \"data-centric\" market as having already caught up with its traditional PC-centric market, with almost 50% of its Q3 revenue derived from data-centric products. The majority of the operating income (roughly speaking, profit) returns from those products is outpacing the traditional market as well.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/other-data-centric-revenue-q3-980x555.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          \"Other data-centric business segments\" refers in part to the company's Mobileye driver-assist and semi-autonomous vehicle business, as well as Optane and network gear.

The company does still want to talk about CPUs, but there's an increasing pressure for coverage of its AI, networking, and even software efforts as the company shifts footing. We believe that this change in focus is likely a good one for consumers, assuming Intel finds the market growth it's looking for in new segments. With higher growth and margins in newer ventures, consumers can hope that Intel will make good on its stated intent to relax its protectionist stance in the CPU market along the way.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594075&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Total revenue was $64 billion.</p>\n<p>Apple revealed during the proceedings that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/iphone-11-review-the-sweet-spot-iphone/\">iPhone 11</a> (sans <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/09/iphone-11-pro-and-11-pro-max-review-high-quality-for-high-prices/\">Pro</a>) is now its best-selling phone, and that iPhone revenue was $33 billion\u2014a 9% decline over the same quarter the previous fiscal year, albeit an improvement over the 15% decline the company saw in the previous three quarters this year. (That improvement is very likely accounted for by the launch of the iPhone 11 and its ilk mid-September, just before the quarter ended.)</p>\n<p>Mac sales were down 5%, but Apple CEO Tim Cook was quick to point out on the earnings call with investors that the company released a major update to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/apple-updates-entry-level-macbook-air-and-pro-discontinues-macbook/\">MacBook Air</a>, one of its most popular computers, around this time last year but has not done so yet this year, ostensibly explaining some of the drop.</p>\n<p>Apple is expected to refresh some of its laptops in the coming months and plans to imminently launch the pricy <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/our-first-look-photos-of-the-apples-new-mac-pro-and-the-pro-display-xdr/\">Mac Pro</a>. Aimed at creative professionals, the Mac Pro's price point makes it less of a mass-market device than the MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>Apple boasted 18% growth in services revenue, an improvement over the previous quarter that brings the 2019 fiscal year total to $46 billion. It was $12.5 billion for this quarter on its own. Among other things, this was credited to \"all-time record revenues from payment services\" like Apple Pay. The company alluded to the recent launches of Apple Card, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade, but it did not provide individual numbers for them during the call. Apple also said today that this was the best quarter ever for AppleCare.</p>\n<p>The iPad saw 17% growth driven by the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/2018-ipad-pro-review-whats-a-computer/\">iPad Pro</a>, but the big positive narrative from the company was that of wearables, which include Apple Watch and AirPods. The company saw 54% growth in that category, and the quarter in question ended before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> were announced or released.</p>\n<p>In an answer to an investor question, Cook let it be known that he sees wearables like the Watch and its associated health functionality as the future of the company. \"There will be a day in the future that we look back and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Some investors are understandably concerned that many of Apple's growth areas are dependent on the iPhone. Users are sticking with their existing iPhones and opting to go longer between upgrades than ever before, leading to ever-slowing iPhone sales. But Apple stock <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/apple-aapl-earnings-q4-2019.html\">rose</a> slightly after the call regardless, indicating that the market at least believes Apple still has plenty of room to grow in services and wearables in the near term before the iPhone's slowing momentum becomes a serious problem.</p>\n<p>And in some cases, the numbers bear that out: a substantial portion of Apple's wearables revenue (which now stands toe-to-toe with the Mac) comes from customers making a first-time purchase in that category. And Cook again made vague allusions to major new products in the wearables category, which (not his words) could include the company's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/apple-is-working-on-an-ar-headset-with-a-new-os-report-says/\">rumored augmented reality headset</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite those declining iPhone sales, Apple users probably shouldn't be too concerned about the future of the ecosystem they've invested in. The company stated earlier this year that it has an install base of 900 million iPhones globally. Whether that continues to grow is a concern for investors looking for big returns in their portfolios, but not for users; an install base that size all but ensures continued support, content, and updates for many years yet.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to Q1 2020, Apple projects revenue between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion\u2014Q1 is often a big quarter for the company, as it carries holiday sales and much of the immediate post-launch revenue from the new iPhone lineup.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594215&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

And they're not telling tall tales. The lenses can cause infections, sores, scratches, vision-impairing scars, and even blindness. It\u2019s easy to find eye-related horror stories from people who turned to black-market lenses to change the color, shape, or look of their eyes (some lenses even <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/7831901/Famous-and-infamous-sports-marketing-stunts.html?image=2\">add logos</a> to your eyeballs).</p>\n<p>Just on Tuesday, USA Today reported the case of a Cleveland woman who got decorative lenses <a href=\"https://www.today.com/health/woman-goes-er-remove-contact-lenses-stuck-eye-t165627\">stuck to her eyeballs</a>. The lenses were supposed to turn her brown eyes blue but instead made them swollen and red. She had to have them removed in an emergency room.</p>\n<p>Still, decorative lenses have proven incredibly popular. The color-contact-lens market has at times been valued at $300 million, accounting for 15% of the total market for contact lenses.</p>\n<p>People tend to pick them up from street vendors, beauty salons, flea markets, and novelty shops. But selling them over the counter is actually illegal. Contact lenses are considered a medical device and are regulated as such by the Food and Drug Administration. Anyone buying them needs to have a prescription for the lenses.</p>\n<p>The dodgy, black-market lenses often turn out be contaminated, irritating, or simply the wrong size for your eyeball, causing injuries. If they\u2019re too small for your eye or don\u2019t allow enough air through, the lenses can cut off oxygen to the cornea\u2014the clear surface of the eye. This corneal hypoxia can allow infections to fester as well as cause damage the corneal tissue.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s just one of many potential problems. Things get even more dicey when people fail to follow basic contact-care instructions\u2014like cleaning them occasionally and not sleeping with them or sharing them (which can spread infections).</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://insights.ovid.com/pubmed?pmid=16163010\">a 2005 medical report</a>, a team of eye doctors laid out 12 consecutive cases of people arriving in medical centers with severe eye problems after using decorative lenses. The cases range from mild to extreme.</p>\n<h2>Shiver me timbers</h2>\n<p>Patient 1 was a 16-year-old girl who showed up with eye pain and redness after wearing a colored lens. She admitted to sleeping with the lenses as well as sharing them with her younger brother. Doctors treated her with artificial tears and an antibiotic ointment, and her symptoms quickly improved.</p>\n<p>Patient 12, on the other hand, was not so lucky. After buying cat-eye lenses at a flea market, the 26-year-old man developed a severe, painful infection called <em>Acanthamoeba</em> keratitis. The infection is caused by a free-living amoeba running rampant in the cornea, which can be blinding\u2014as it was in this case. \u00a0He ended up needing a corneal transplant, and three months afterwards his vision was still 20/200, which is considered legally blind.</p>\n<p>Patient 11 also suffered permanent vision loss. The 39-year-old woman went to the doctor with pain, redness, and blurred vision in her left eye after buying colored lenses at a hair salon. Her ophthalmologist quickly spotted an ulcer in the center of her cornea, which was positive for the pathogenic bacteria <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. She was admitted to the hospital for intensive antibiotic therapy. But two months later, her best corrected vision in the affected eye was only 20/50.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-4.23.05-PM.jpeg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Patient 9, a 16-year-old girl who bought colored lenses at a flea market, had a central corneal ulcer positive for <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>.

While Patient 11 told doctors that she regularly cleaned her black-market lenses, Patient 2\u2014a 16-year-old girl\u2014kept hers in dirty cases with obvious debris and continued to use them after doctors told her to stop.</p>\n<p>When doctors analyzed the lenses, they found multiple bacteria normally found in the intestines (and feces) including <em>Klebsiella</em> species, <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</em> Two lenses also contained acanthamoeba\u2014the amoeba that caused Patient 12\u2019s blindness. One lens was positive for a fungal <em>Fusarium</em> species. The lens solutions and cases were positive for bacteria <em>Serratia marcescens</em>, <em>Serratia fonticola</em>, and <em>Klebsiella</em> species.</p>\n<p>Patient 2 was seen multiple times for persistent infection and irritation but stopped going to appointments after six weeks.</p>\n<p>Such poor hygiene and care practices can cause eye infections and damage with any type of contact lens. But doing so with sketchy fashion lenses is particularly dangerous.</p>\n<p>If you really want to change the look of your eye, the FDA emphasizes that it\u2019s very important to buy <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/contact-lenses/list-contact-lenses\">FDA-approved decorative lenses</a> through your eye doctor or another reputable vendor\u2014with your prescription.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594115&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

The attack was apparently tracked back to one thing the organizations had in common: a managed service provider. With limited IT resources of their own, local governments have increasingly turned to MSPs to operate significant portions of their networks and applications, as have other organizations and businesses\u2014often placing critical parts of their business operations in the MSPs' hands. And that has made MSPs a very attractive target to ransomware operators.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.armor.com/reports/new-msps-%20compromised-reports-armor\">Threat researchers at the global cloud security provider Armor</a> have been tracking publicly-reported incidents in which MSP and cloud service providers have been hit with ransomware. Thus far, they have documented 13 such incidents this year\u2014with 6 of them reported in the past few months.</p>\n<p>The most recent publicly exposed victim is Billtrust, which as<a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/10/ransomware-hits-b2b-payments-firm-billtrust/\"> security journalist Brian Krebs reported,</a> was hit by <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/billing-provider-billtrust-suffers-outage-after-malware-attack/\">what BleepingComputer reported was BitPaymer ransomware</a> (a report that has not been confirmed). BillTrust is an online invoicing and billing provider based in New Jersey that also provides credit decision services. Billtrust executives sent an email to customers on October 22, informing them of the attack, stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our standard security and back-up procedures have been and remain instrumental in our ability to execute the ongoing restoration of services... Out of an abundance of caution, we cannot disclose the precise ransomware strains but will do so as soon as prudently possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other victims include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SchoolinSites, a cloud-based service provider for school districts that offered websites and parental access to student information, <a href=\"https://www.wkrg.com/news/mcpss-website-hacked-by-virus/\">was taken down in an attack in September</a> as reported by WKRG in Mobile, Alabama. The company's email was affected as well as other communications; SchoolinSites had to use Facebook to provide updates during the outage, which began on September 23.</li>\n<li>TrialWorks, a Florida-based case management software provider, was <a href=\"https://www.lawsitesblog.com/2019/10/ransomware-attack-reportedly-hits-practice-management-company-locking-lawyers-out-of-their-case-files.html\">hit by a ransomware attack the week of October 14.</a> The company, which serves about 2,500 law firms, acknowledged the ransomware attack and said that, while it did not impact their software, about 5% of the company's customers could not access their accounts.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2019/06/13/calif-mls-giant-temporarily-shuts-down-after-malware-attack\">California-based MetroList,</a> a real estate multiple listing and application services firm with about 20,000 real estate broker customers, was hit by ransomware in June, taking the company's services offline for two days. MetroList reportedly paid the ransom, which included a $10,000 insurance deductible.</li>\n<li>Also on October 14, <a href=\"https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/ascension/article_b6194b7a-eba2-11e9-a388-5b6eedc7c596.html\">Magnolia Pediatrics of Prairieville, Louisiana</a>, was reportedly hit by ransomware via the practice's managed IT services provider. Magnolia reported the ransomware to law enforcement.</li>\n<li>In July, CorVel, a managed service provider for insurance companies handling workers compensation, auto, health, and disability claims, <a href=\"https://www.joepaduda.com/2019/07/26/corvels-problem-may-be-ransomware/\">got hit by Ryuk ransomware</a>. As the company responded, systems used to process claims, email and phone systems, and healthcare provider databases were taken offline.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Organizations using full-service IT-managed service providers, such as Magnolia Pediatrics, are particularly at risk because the security of all of their systems is dependent on that of the MSP. As was the case in Texas, this meant that all their data was put at risk. In Magnolia's case, all patient data was encrypted, but it could just as easily have been stolen by attackers\u2014and since that data includes personal identifying data for children, it could have significant long-term consequences. A clinic spokesperson said that \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Magnolia advised patients' families to monitor credit card statements and credit bureau reports.</p>\n<p>These issues are why having a conversation (and a contract) with a service provider that includes security is so important.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594073&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

That's because they won't be allowed to pay for political advertising.</p>\n<p>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has apparently taken a look at the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/no-you-apparently-cant-run-for-office-just-to-put-false-ads-on-facebook/\">controversy</a> currently embroiling Facebook and decided he wants no part of it.</p>\n<p>\"We've made the decision to stop all political advertising on Twitter globally,\" Dorsey announced in, naturally, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1189634377057067008\">a tweet</a>. </p>\n<p>He framed the choice as an opportunity for anyone with a message, rather than a penalty, adding, \"A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money.\"</p>\n<p>The ban applies not only to candidates and their campaigns but also to \"issue ads\" by any group, Dorsey continued, since those \"present a way to circumvent\" the ban on political advertising and would present a situation where \"everyone but candidates\" could pay to have their view on an issue promoted. He also added an apparent dig at Facebook:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For instance, it's not credible for us to say: \"We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad... well...they can say whatever they want! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"\ud83d\ude09\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" />\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>\"This isn't about free expression,\" Dorsey went on. \"This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today's democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It's worth stepping back in order to address.\"</p>\n<h2>Direct challenge</h2>\n<p>The stance comes in direct opposition to social media leader Facebook, which explicitly exempts both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/facebook-confirms-its-standards-dont-apply-to-politicians/\">posts</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/political-ads-can-lie-if-they-want-facebook-confirms/\">advertisements</a> made by politicians from its community standards and fact-checking process. </p>\n<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly doubled down on his company's position amid a firestorm of criticism from lawmakers, political candidates, and even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebooks-new-political-ad-policy-already-showing-cracks-loopholes/\">employees</a>. In a congressional hearing last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) directly challenged Zuckerberg on the company's policy.</p>\n<p>\"Do you see a potential problem here with the complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\" Ocasio-Cortez asked.</p>\n<p>\"Well, congresswoman, I think lying is bad,\" Zuckerberg replied. \"I think if you're gonna lie, that would be bad.\" But that would be different from preventing people from \"seeing that you had lied,\" he tried to explain.</p>\n<p>\"So you will take down lies, or you won't take down lies? I think this is a pretty simple yes or no,\" she pressed.</p>\n<p>\"In a democracy, I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote down are saying,\" he answered. Any actions Facebook might take \"depends on the context\" in which a dishonest piece of content is posted, he added.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594105&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Apple's habit of late has been to release most of its operating system updates for each platform all on the same day. But in this instance, though, macOS and watchOS came a single day after iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS updates.</p>\n<p>The macOS update mainly adds features we already saw yesterday in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-and-ipados-13-2/\">iOS and iPadOS 13.2</a>. That includes support for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, the ability to opt in or out of sharing Siri recordings with Apple, new emoji, and new HomeKit feature support. There are also a number of macOS-specific bug fixes and the restoration of some lost Photos features.</p>\n<p>Here are Apple's update notes for macOS Catalina 10.15.1:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The macOS Catalina 10.15.1 update includes updated and additional emoji, support for AirPods Pro, HomeKit Secure Video, HomeKit enabled routers, and new Siri privacy settings, as well as bug fixes and improvements.</p>\n<p><strong>Emoji</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Over 70 new or updated emoji, including animals, food, activities, new accessibility emoji, gender-neutral emoji, and skin tones selection for couple emoji</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>AirPods</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduces support for AirPods Pro</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Home app</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HomeKit Secure Video enables you to privately capture, store, and view encrypted video from your security cameras and features people, animal, and vehicle detection</li>\n<li>HomeKit-enabled routers let you control how your HomeKit accessories communicate over the Internet or in your home</li>\n<li>Adds support for AirPlay 2-enabled speakers in scenes and automations</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Siri</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy settings to control whether or not to help improve Siri and Dictation by allowing Apple to store audio of your Siri and Dictation interactions</li>\n<li>Option to delete your Siri and Dictation history from Siri Settings</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This update also includes the following bug fixes and improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Restores the ability to view file names in the All Photos view in Photos</li>\n<li>Restores the ability to filter by favorites, photos, videos, edited, and keywords in Days view in Photos</li>\n<li>Fixes an issue where Messages would only send a single notification when the option to repeat alerts was enabled</li>\n<li>Resolves an issue that caused Contacts to launch to the previously opened contact instead of the contact list</li>\n<li>Adds a two-finger swipe gesture for back navigation in Apple News</li>\n<li>Resolves issues that may occur in the Music app when displaying playlists inside folders and newly added songs in the Songs list</li>\n<li>Improves reliability of migrating iTunes library databases into the Music, Podcasts, and TV apps</li>\n<li>Fixes an issue where downloaded titles were not visible in the Downloads folder in the TV app</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>watchOS 6.1 is a very small update; its main purpose appears to be AirPods Pro support; users can now manage their active-noise-cancelation settings via the Watch for the new earphones. Additionally, Apple has brought watchOS 6 to the series 1 and series 2 Apple Watch devices as previously promised. (They were not supported by the first release of watchOS 6.)</p>\n<p>Here are Apple's brief watchOS 6.1 update notes:</p>\n<blockquote><p>watchOS 6.1 introduces support for \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c and includes improvements and bug fixes. This update also brings \u200cwatchOS 6\u200c to \u200cApple Watch\u200c Series 1 and Series 2.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, Apple released a security update labeled watchOS 5.3.3 for Apple Watches not running watchOS 6. This is necessary even though watchOS 6 supports all Watch models now because watchOS 6 only works with iPhones that can run iOS 13, but some users are on older handsets.</p>\n<p>Both updates should be available to all users today.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593945&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

But there are ways to study personality empirically\u2014they just involve accepting a lot of imperfection and fuzziness.</p>\n<p>The \"Big Five\" personality traits do seem to get at something meaningful about human personality. They certainly don't capture everything, but Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism are traits that can be measured with a high degree of stability from one test to the next. They change in predictable ways across people's lifespans and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/08/meta-analysis-shows-psychotherapy-leads-to-long-term-personality-change/\">with therapy</a>, and they seem to be related in measurable ways to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/programmers-are-a-tiny-bit-introverted-but-otherwise-agreeable/\">people's lives</a> outside the context of a personality test.</p>\n<p>One of those traits\u2014conscientiousness\u2014is, unsurprisingly, strongly related to how people perform at work. But why, and in what settings? A paper published this week in PNAS used the data from more than 2,500 studies to summarize what we know about conscientiousness. Unexpectedly, the authors find that conscientiousness scores make less of a difference to people's performance when they're in high-complexity careers. Instead, they mainly seems to matter in low- or moderate-complexity jobs.</p>\n<h2>More than just being neat</h2>\n<p>Human personality is, obviously, an incredibly tricky thing to measure. People's personalities are somewhat stable from one week or month to the next, but how they're feeling on the day of the test will obviously change their answers to an extent. And the phenomenon of personality itself is obviously incredibly complex.</p>\n<p>So a Big Five personality test doesn't try to carve people into distinct categories\u2014either an extrovert or an introvert, agreeable or not. Instead, it places people on a sliding scale relative to other people on each of the five traits. You could be in the top 30% of extraverted people but still know people more extraverted than you.</p>\n<p>Each trait breaks down into different facets that try to capture different components of it. The questions used to assess conscientiousness tap into a combination of someone's orderliness, cautiousness, self-discipline, dutifulness, achievement-striving, and a facet called \"self-efficacy\" (which is related to behaviors like finishing tasks properly). Together, these facets all get at slightly different angles of what it means to be \"conscientious.\"</p>\n<p>The Big Five traits offer a way of capturing people's personalities that is obviously imperfect, but\u00a0 they still have a meaningful connection with how people behave in the real world. If you take a group of 1,000 people and test their conscientiousness and then their job performance, you'll find that higher conscientiousness and higher job performance go hand in hand. If you then randomly pull one very conscientious person out of the 1,000, there's a reasonably good chance (but no certainty!) that they'll do well at a job.</p>\n<p>Measuring conscientiousness is obviously handy for employers trying to figure out who to employ. To cut through the variability inherent in individual studies, researchers Michael Wilmot and Deniz Ones threw together a huge amount of data from hundreds of studies to get a more precise estimate on how and why conscientiousness matters.</p>\n<h2>Creatures of habit</h2>\n<p>Wilmot and Ones went a step beyond using a meta-analysis and performed a meta-meta-analysis. They used 92 meta-analyses, which pulled data from more than 2,500 studies and more than a million participants. This should provide an unusually precise estimate of just how much conscientiousness matters.</p>\n<p>Results from the huge dataset showed that conscientiousness was strongly related to positive work behaviors. For instance, people high in conscientiousness were good at setting goals and avoiding procrastination. They were less aggressive and less irresponsible than people with low conscientiousness.</p>\n<p>But there were some results that won't sound quite so obvious. For instance, conscientiousness is related to conformity and security, so a \"preference for more predictable environments\" was a strong theme in the results, the researchers write.</p>\n<p>Perhaps because of this, conscientiousness seemed to make more of a difference in some careers than others. In jobs that were high in complexity, it didn't make much of a difference at all. Meanwhile, in jobs that were moderate in complexity, like customer service and sales, conscientiousness made a much bigger difference.</p>\n<p>The researchers suggest that high-complexity jobs, which require creative problem solving, aren't necessarily a great match for highly conscientious people who want structure and predictability in their work. But it might also be that complex jobs tend to attract conscientious people, and so everyone in those professions is already pretty high in conscientiousness, with less difference among them. Another possibility is that there are jobs where high conscientiousness is a minimum threshold for making it in and just one of a suite of traits that are necessary for doing well, says\u00a0Marcus Cred\u00e9, who researches conscientiousness but wasn't involved in the paper.</p>\n<h2>Personality change</h2>\n<p>The paper does a great job of pulling together a mountain of evidence on what researchers have suspected about conscientiousness, says Cred\u00e9, but there are some caveats. The research itself isn't weak, but measuring people's personalities is just incredibly tricky. If you test someone's conscientiousness while they're filling in a job application, they're obviously going to presenting themselves in a certain way\u2014so their answers will reflect not just their actual conscientiousness, but also their awareness of what an employer will be looking for.</p>\n<p>Wilmot and Ones suggest that it would be a good idea to try improving conscientiousness in schoolkids. Cred\u00e9, though, isn't so sure. Conscientiousness does tend to increase with age, but changing it intentionally is a different matter. \"I'm not aware of any particularly successful intervention program,\" he says.</p>\n<p>It's possible that some of the facets of conscientiousness could respond to training, he adds\u2014safety training, for instance, could possibly increase people's cautiousness. But \"getting someone to be more achievement-striving? It'd be lovely if you could! You could make a lot of money if you could figure that out.\"</p>\n<p><em>You can take a Big Five test <a href=\"http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/ipipneo120.htm\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>PNAS, 2018.

That policy frees up holders of political jobs, and candidates seeking those jobs, to, basically, lie their entire faces off in Facebook ads if they choose to do so.</p>\n<p>The Internet and the 21st century being what they are, of course, many people greeted this news with responses along the lines of: \"Does that mean I can just sign up for any local race and then put any ads I want on Facebook?\" One man decided to find out. And so far, at least, the answer seems to be: No. </p>\n<p>Adriel Hampton lives in California and runs a digital marketing firm that promotes progressive causes. On Monday, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/facebook-false-ads-california-governor/index.html\">formally registered</a> as a candidate for the state's gubernatorial race, and his <a href=\"https://civichall.org/civicist/op-ed-its-time-to-challenge-techs-power-at-the-ballot-box/\">stated platform</a> explicitly challenges both President Donald Trump and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>\n<p>His plan, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/tech/facebook-false-ads-california-governor/index.html\">told CNN</a>, was to use his new status as a political candidate to buy ads on Facebook promoting false content about Trump, Zuckerberg, and others explicitly to call attention to Facebook's policies and force the company to change them.</p>\n<h2>Who\u2019s a politician?</h2>\n<p>Hampton's bid to become the Golden State's next head honcho isn't his first foray into challenging Facebook's ad policies. In fact, it's not even his first headline-grabbing Facebook-related action in the last week.</p>\n<p>Hampton also runs a political action committee, The Really Online Lefty League (TROLL), which a few days ago lived up to its name by purchasing a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-facebook/facebook-takes-down-false-ad-from-pac-on-republican-graham-idUSKBN1X50IZ\">stunt advertisement</a> claiming Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) supports the Green New Deal, a progressive policy package and the signature proposal of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y). </p>\n<p>Graham, who is a devoted Republican, is as ardent an opponent of the Green New Deal as you might expect and <a href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/oct/28/blog-posting/no-lindsey-graham-does-not-support-green-new-deal/\">has said</a>: \"There's not one Republican going to vote for anything coming out of the Green New Deal 'cause it\u2019s crazy.\"</p>\n<p>Facebook suspended the ad's paid distribution. It said that\u2014because the promotion came from a third-party PAC rather than directly from a candidate or politician\u2014it was eligible for review and removal under the site's policy.</p>\n<p>Launching a campaign doesn't appear to be enough to make Hampton a legitimately exempt advertiser in Facebook's eyes, though. Facebook <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/tech/facebook-california-candidate-false-ads/index.html\">told CNN</a>, \"This person has made clear he registered as a candidate to get around our policies, so his content, including ads, will continue to be eligible for third-party fact-checking.\"</p>\n<p>Hampton responded to CNN that Facebook, \"made a policy specific to me, and I am running for California governor to regulate Facebook,\" adding, \"I am going to look at suing them\u2014I will immediately seek all available legal options.\"</p>\n<h2>Beyond stunts</h2>\n<p>The fight around what Facebook does or does not allow on its site is already beyond exhausting\u2014but it's almost certainly going to get worse before (or if) it manages to get better. US politicians on all sides are wading into the fray, and with the 2020 election <em>almost</em> finally less than a year away, tensions are only going to intensify.</p>\n<p>The current fight over political ads on Facebook began when President Donald Trump's re-election campaign <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/political-ads-can-lie-if-they-want-facebook-confirms/\">ran a false ad</a> about former Vice President Joe Biden, who is among the leading candidates seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. The site refused to pull the spot, kicking off outrage, especially from Biden's fellow Democrats.</p>\n<p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another leading contender in the crowded 2020 field, herself <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1183019880867680256?lang=en\">launched a false ad</a> on Facebook earlier this month to draw attention to what she sees as the platform's failings. \"Breaking news,\" the ad begins: \"Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election.\"</p>\n<p>It immediately reveals the deception as it goes on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, \"how could this possibly be true?\"</p>\n<p>Well, it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is give Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform\u2014and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Facebook inexplicably used its official news twitter account to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1183162508846215168\">challenge Warren</a>, comparing itself to legacy TV broadcasters, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. Facebook, however, is not subject to regulation by the FCC\u2014nor would company leadership particularly want it to be, one assumes.</p>\n<p>\"You're making my point here,\" Warren responded. \"It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards.\"</p>\n<p>Investigations by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/28/pro-trump-super-pacs-draw-scrutiny-facebook-ads-seeking-voter-registration-data/\">The Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-latinos-analysis/vamos-to-victory-trumps-spanish-ads-skirt-immigration-warn-of-socialism-idUSKBN1X913E\">Reuters</a>, and others, meanwhile, show that questionable political advertising by third parties is not only rampant, but also can stay up on Facebook until media attention causes the company to pull it down.</p>\n<p>Employees, meanwhile, are reportedly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/facebooks-new-political-ad-policy-already-showing-cracks-loopholes/\">no happier with the contentious policy than anyone else</a>: more than 250 Facebook workers have signed onto an open letter asking the company to adopt new standards for political ads.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593859&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

A year ago, <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2018/4q-2018/4Q18%20Earnings%20Release.pdf\">AT&amp;T said</a> it would spend $23 billion on gross capital investment in 2019. (These numbers include network construction and vendor-financing payments but do not include some spending on AT&amp;T's FirstNet public safety network, which is reimbursed by the federal government.)</p>\n<p>The company is on pace to exceed its 2019 goal as it averaged <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/3Q19_Trending%20Schedules.pdf\">more than $6 billion per quarter</a> in the first three quarters. But with a forecast of $20 billion across all of 2020, AT&amp;T expects to spend about $5 billion per quarter on capital investments going forward. The company is under pressure from investors to control spending, in part because its TV business is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/att-loses-another-1-3-million-tv-customers-as-directv-freefall-continues/\">tanking</a> and because of AT&amp;T's giant debt load stemming from the purchases of DirecTV and Time Warner.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T increased capital investment between 2018 and 2019, but its 2020 outlook would push the company's spending to lower than its 2018 total of $21.8 billion. AT&amp;T, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/05/att-promised-7000-new-jobs-to-get-tax-break-it-cut-23000-jobs-instead/\">as you might remember</a>, promised increased capital spending and thousands of new jobs in exchange for a corporate tax cut and <a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/108302543725436/AT%26T%20reply%20comments%2017-108.pdf\">claimed</a> that the now-repealed federal net neutrality rules harmed broadband-network investment.\u00a0The tax cut alone\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-sees-big-benefit-from-tax-law-1517434789\">reportedly</a>\u00a0gave AT&amp;T an extra $3 billion in cash in 2018, and it continues to give the company <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-corporate-income-tax-work\">lower tax rates</a> each year. Despite that, AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/3Q19_Investor%20Briefing.pdf\">said</a> it has cut its workforce from 269,280 employees to 251,840 employees in the past year.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T's capital spending will decline next year despite the company's plan to roll 5G mobile service out nationwide. AT&amp;T already got much of the 5G spending out of the way by purchasing spectrum licenses, and AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson <a href=\"https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/financial-reports/quarterly-earnings/2019/3q-2019/ATT%203Q19%20Transcript.pdf\">told investors</a> that the company's \"strong spectrum position will allow for lower capital intensity\" over the next three years.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T has also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/06/att-cuts-another-1800-jobs-as-it-finishes-fiber-internet-buildout/\">mostly stopped</a> its fiber-to-the-home broadband construction even though large portions of its 21-state territory still have only copper-based DSL service. Fiber deployment isn't stopping completely, as Stephenson said that \"5G requires us to continue deploying fiber.\" But AT&amp;T customers who can't get modern broadband speeds or reliable wireline service in their homes would welcome more capital investment in their neighborhoods.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T's capital investment has an outsized influence on the industry numbers as a whole.

(credit: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"caption-link\" href=\"https://www.inscom.army.mil/msc/780mib/\">780th Military Intelligence Brigade</a>)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>COLUMBIA, Md.\u2014In a business park that plays home to a number of tech and cybersecurity firms situated strategically between Washington, DC, and Baltimore, there's a two-story building that looks externally like many other office buildings, remarkable this day only for the food trucks in the parking lot and the stream of people in camouflage swarming in and out. The building, called <a href=\"https://dreamport.tech/index.php\">DreamPort</a>, is a collaboration facility leased by US Cyber Command\u2014and on October 18, it was the location of <a href=\"https://www.avengercon.com/\">AvengerCon IV</a>, the latest incarnation of a soldier-led cybersecurity training event that takes the shape of a community hacking conference.</p>\n<p>The event also offered USCYBERCOM a chance to show off DreamPort\u2014and a chance for me to meet with <a href=\"https://www.cybercom.mil/About/Leadership/Bio-Display/Article/1651709/executive-director-uscybercom/\">David Luber</a>, the Executive Director of USCYBERCOM.</p>\n<p>\"AvengerCon is an event that is attracting the very best talent both from our DoD participants and also from some of the folks that are working with us outside of the DoD,\" Luber said. \"When you bring those very best cyber experts together, they get to learn, test out new ideas, and work in an environment that is hosted by and for DoD cyber operations community experts. They're working in a community of peers\u2014they get to learn together, they get to fail together. And what we've seen from previous activities with AvengerCon is that it's an exhilarating, fun environment for them to work in, and they learn a ton while they're here. And the private sector benefits because as AvengerCon shows, we're all working on some of the same cyber challenges together.\"</p>\n<p>AvengerCon is an effort to bring the learning environment provided by security conferences such as DEFCON to a military and government community that wouldn't otherwise be available because of cost and bureaucratic complexity. Originally a training event organized by the 781st Military Intelligence Battalion at Fort Meade involving about 100 soldiers, AvengerCon has grown to 600 attendees and has gained the backing of Army Cyber Command and USCYBERCOM.</p>\n\n<p>\"My job, in part, is trying to figure out how to properly train soldiers in a field that doesn't have decades of standard operating procedures and clear paths for training to get to success,\" Capt. Joseph Dooley, an organizer of AvengerCon, told Ars. He said that this type of event offered \"a unique opportunity for soldiers to individually be in a more unstructured environment where they can set their own agenda\"\u2014where they can pick things that they're interested in or feel they need training in without the usual constraints of formal Army training.</p>\n<p>The event \"complements efforts in regular unit training,\" Dooley explained. \"And it gives [attendees] the chance to collaborate with subject-matter experts [and] share and compare tradecraft, best practices, and ideas. This is a very good way to boost our other conventional training.\"</p>\n<p>Sgt. 1st Class Craig Seiler, another member of the AvengerCon organizing committee, said that bringing together people from across the cyber operations community in government provided a boost to the learning opportunities. \"What we've found is mixing all these different types of people\u2014developers, people doing operations\u2014they all do great things separately, but when they get together later on, they say, 'Hey, I really learned something from that analyst or that developer that I've picked up to bring to my current job.'\"</p>\n<p>I attended last year's AvengerCon, held on Fort Meade, at the invitation of the unit organizing the event, the 780th Military Intelligence Brigade (Cyber). While AvengerCon III was clearly a success, this year's expanded event puts AvengerCon on the scale of well-established regional security conferences. The keynote speaker was security researcher Daniel Cuthbert, who is Global Head of Cyber Security Research for Grupo Santander and co-author of the original Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Guide and the OWASP Application Security Verification Standard. He spoke largely on the issues surrounding information-sharing and collaboration in the cybersecurity realm.</p>\n<h2>Beyond the base</h2>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/191017-O-PX639-242-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Keynote speaker Daniel Cuthbert addresses attendees at AvengerCon IV.

Fortunately, the success of AvengerCon drew the attention of US Cyber Command, and the organizers were offered the use of DreamPort for the event's next iteration.</p>\n<p>AvengerCon fits neatly into DreamPort's mission to foster collaboration between US Cyber Command, the rest of the Department of Defense and intelligence community, and industry.</p>\n<p>\"We opened the facility here in Columbia, Maryland, back in the fall of 2018,\" Luber said, \"created under a partnership intermediary agreement between US Cyber Command and the Maryland Innovation and Security Institute [MISI]. We've hosted over 14,000 visitors in this 40,000-square-foot facility, and in June of 2019, MISI signed an expansion lease to double the size of DreamPort by the end of 2020. So, we're really happy about the partnership that we've had so far.\"</p>\n<p>Companies and individuals can come into the unclassified facility to demonstrate capabilities during \"challenges\" and events hosted by the facility looking at specific cybersecurity issues. These include critical infrastructure security events simulated in \"Dream Valley,\" a scale model village connected to actual industrial control systems and other operational technology.</p>\n<h2>Off base</h2>\n<p>DreamPort's planned expansion is probably a good thing, considering how AvengerCon has grown. In the past, the event was limited to Army personnel, but now it includes attendees from across the Department of Defense and other government agencies tied to cyber operations, as well as students and representatives of industry.</p>\n<p>\"We felt we needed to branch out and start making sure that we are supporting the community better each year as we expand,\" said Seiler. \"The growth is great, but it also brings in other woes and requirements.\" The logistics of getting people onto Fort Meade was one of them, Seiler explained\u2014while it provided a natural level of security around the event, using the base made drawing on outside resources difficult and limited who could be brought in to attend.</p>\n<p>\"We found it works better if it's off base,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Using DreamPort opened up the opportunity to add resources provided by outside organizations that \"connect to our mission,\" Seiler said. Those included the \"villages\" at the event brought in by security community organizations\u2014including ICS Village's industrial control systems \"capture the flag\" competition (in which attendees looked for ways to compromise simulated plant hardware) and the Voting Village's collection of voting-machine hardware and exploration of election security.</p>\n<p>\"The election thing was nice to have,\" said Seiler. \"I don't know if it was our big thing, but lots of people are talking about it... it sparks conversation, which was the intent of accepting something like that. That's the intent of all the villages\u2014to build the conversations.\"</p>\n<p>The additional space allowed for the expansion of AvengerCon's training workshops, which included day-long classes in reverse-engineering and software \"fuzzing.\" Additionally, the event hosted a simulation called \"The Day After\"\u2014in which teams from the US Naval Academy, James Madison University, American University, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, simulated strategies for government agencies to respond to a large-scale cyberattack on the United States.</p>\n<h2>More, better cyber</h2>\n<p>The success of AvengerCon has prompted plans to replicate it in some form for the military and intelligence cyber community at Fort Gordon in Georgia. But the organizers also want to make sure that AvengerCon itself doesn't outgrow its grassroots, community feel. They also want it to stay focused on its mission. That fits into the overall USCYBERCOM strategy for DreamPort, which has an ongoing calendar of highly focused events surrounding the command's \"Persistent Innovation\" strategy.</p>\n<p>\"You know that cyberspace is under constant change,\" said Luber. \"It requires us to constantly innovate, and innovation just doesn't happen in government. It's also happening in industry, academia. We need a place to work, we need a place to meet, and we need a place to innovate, and DreamPort provides that combination for us.\"</p>\n<p>In addition to providing an environment for academic outreach to high schools and universities, Luber said DreamPort is \"a mission accelerator, an incubator for US Cyber Command where projects are conducted with the goal of completing those projects within 90 days. So think of that innovation process where you've got an idea, you've got a concept, you want to run it quickly, and if you fail, you fail fast. And if you succeed, you've moved to the next step where you try and get it to operational capabilities.\"</p>\n<p>Conducting those projects in an unclassified environment, Luber said, encourages the sharing of ideas and speeds up the creation of new solutions to cyber security issues.</p>\n<h2>Rapid prototyping</h2>\n<p>Some of those projects include rapid-prototyping events in which \"we bring industry partners in from all different sizes, small businesses, large businesses, and then have them work the problem,\" Luber explained. \"We've had six rapid-prototyping events over the course of the past year. We've seen even one-person companies outperform some of the bigger prime contractors that you might think that we're dealing with on a regular basis.\"</p>\n<p>One of DreamPort's recent rapid-prototyping events was run by USCYBERCOM in partnership with the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Small Business and Manufacturing. It focused on protecting the security of small businesses within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) with the application of \"zero trust\" network security, which is an architectural approach to handling application and information security that would help protect their security regardless of the overall security of the network environment.</p>\n<p>The project looked at ways to apply zero-trust architecture, not just to the DIB, but to Department of Defense information systems and networks as well. \"By bringing together talent from DISA, NSA, USCYBERCOM, and industry, we were able to really work on some interesting prototyping activities, and it's going to help us drive the future for the Department,\" Luber said.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593887&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

But as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we argued at the time</a>, it wasn't quite a fair fight. Now AlphaStar has improved on its performance sufficiently to achieve Grandmaster status in <em>StarCraft II,</em> using the same interface as a human player. The team described its work in <a href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/alphastar/AlphaStar_unformatted.pdf\">a new paper</a> in Nature.</p>\n<p>\"This is a dream come true,\" said DeepMind co-author Oriol Vinyals, who was an avid <em>StarCraft</em> player 20 years ago. \"AlphaStar achieved Grandmaster level solely with a neural network and general-purpose learning algorithms\u2014which was unimaginable ten years ago when I was researching <em>StarCraft</em> AI using rules-based systems.\"</p>\n<p>Late last year, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/move-over-alphago-alphazero-taught-itself-to-play-three-different-games/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">we reported on</a> the latest achievements of AlphaZero, a direct descendent of DeepMind's AlphaGo, which made headlines worldwide in 2016 by defeating Lee Sedol, the reigning (human) world champion in Go. AlphaGo got <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">a major upgrade</a> last year, becoming capable of teaching itself winning strategies with no need for human intervention. By playing itself over and over again, AlphaZero trained itself to play Go from scratch in just three days and soundly defeated the original AlphaGo 100 games to 0. The only input it received was the basic rules of the game. Then AlphaZero <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">taught itself</a> to play three different board games (chess, Go, and shogi, a Japanese form of chess) in just three days, with no human intervention.</p>\n<p>The secret ingredient: \"reinforcement learning,\" in which playing itself for millions of games allows the program to learn from experience. This works because AlphaZero is rewarded for the most useful actions (i.e., devising winning strategies). The AI does this by considering the most probable next moves and calculating the probability of winning for each of them. The most recent version combined deep reinforcement learning (many layers of neural networks) with a general-purpose Monte Carlo tree search method. As chess grandmaster <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1087\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gary Kasparov wrote</a> in an editorial in Science last year, \"Instead of processing human instructions and knowledge at tremendous speed, as all previous chess machines, AlphaZero generates its own knowledge.\"</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg\"><img alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar&#039;s base, showcasing robustness.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3-640x400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg 2x\" alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar&#039;s base, showcasing robustness.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft3.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">AlphaStar (Zerg, in red) defending an early aggression where the opponent built part of the base near AlphaStar's base, showcasing robustness.</a> (credit: DeepMind)</p></div>\n<p>With AlphaZero's success, DeepMind's focus shifted to a new AI frontier: games of partial (incomplete) information, like poker, and multi-player video games like <em>Starcraft II</em>. <em>StarCraft II</em> is also a game of incomplete information, and there is no single best strategy, much like playing rock-paper-scissors. It requires long-range planning ability and real-time decision-making in a large action space. Not only is the gameplay map hidden to players, but they must also control hundreds of units (mobile game pieces that can be built to influence the game) and buildings (used to create units or technologies that strengthen those units) simultaneously. As Ars' Tim Lee (an avid <em>StarCraft</em> player) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrote in January</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"<em>StarCraft</em> requires players to gather resources, build dozens of military units, and use them to try to destroy their opponents. <em>StarCraft</em> is particularly challenging for an AI because players must carry out long-term plans over several minutes of gameplay, tweaking them on the fly in the face of enemy counterattacks. DeepMind says that prior to its own effort, no one had come close to designing a <em>StarCraft</em> AI as good as the best human players.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>That earlier version of AlphaStar also relied on deep reinforcement learning to teach the program to mimic human strategies. At that point, the AI was proficient enough to defeat Elite-level players roughly 95% of the time. Then the DeepMind team created variants of that AI, each adopting a different playing style, and placed them into a virtual <em>StarCraft</em> league. This allowed the agents to learn from their mistakes and evolve their strategies accordingly. Then DeepMind selected the five strongest agents and pitted them against two human professional players: Dario \"TLO\" Wunsch and Grzegorz \"MaNa\" Komincz. The AI defeated its human challengers in all ten games.</p>\n<p>That said, it wasn't quite a fair fight. \"The ultimate way to level the playing field would be to make AlphaStar use the exact same user interface as human players,\" <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/an-ai-crushed-two-human-pros-at-starcraft-but-it-wasnt-a-fair-fight/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lee wrote</a> in January. \"The interface could be virtualized, of course, but the game should get the same raw pixel inputs as a human player and should be required to input instructions using a sequence of mouse movements and keystrokes\u2014with inputs limited to speeds that human hands can achieve. This is the only way to be completely sure that AlphaStar isn't giving its software an unfair advantage.\"</p>\n<h2>Playing like a human</h2>\n<p>This latest version of AlphaStar goes a long way toward addressing those issues, combining deep reinforcement learning with multi-agent learning and imitation learning directly from game data, honed once again via a virtual league. <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">Per a blog post</a> by Vinyals and fellow DeepMind co-author\u00a0Wojciech Czarnecki, the new, improved AlphaStar was subject to the same constraints under which humans play, and it played on Battle.net \"using the same maps and conditions as human players.\"</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg\"><img alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2-640x400.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg 2x\" alt='AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/starcraft2.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">AlphaStar (Zerg, in green) winning a final encounter using late-game, high-tech units.</a> (credit: DeepMind)</p></div>\n<p>\"The key insight of the league is that playing to win is insufficient,\" <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">Vinyals and Czarnecki wrote</a> of the improvements to this latest incarnation of AlphaStar. \"Instead, we need both main agents whose goal is to win versus everyone, and also exploiter agents that 'take one for the team.' focusing on helping the main agent grow stronger by exposing its flaws, rather than maximizing their own win rate. Using this training method, the current league learns all its complex <em>StarCraft II</em> strategy in an end-to-end fashion\u2014as opposed to the earlier incarnation of our work, which stitched together agents produced by a variety of methods and algorithms.\"</p>\n<p>The AI can also now play as or against the three races in <em>Starcraft II</em>: Protoss, Terran, and Zerg. (The earlier version only played Protoss vs. Protoss.) DeepMind pitted AlphaStar against human players in a series of online games. The AI was rated at Grandmaster level for all three <em>StarCraft II</em> races and above 99.8% of officially ranked human players. It's the first AI to achieve that status in a popular professional e-sport, without using a simplified version of the game. That's a strong indication that these types of general-purpose machine-learning algorithms could be used to solve complex real-world problems such as personal assistants, self-driving cars, or robotics\u2014all of which require real-time decisions on the basis of imperfect information.</p>\n<p>\"At DeepMind, we're interested in understanding the potential\u2014and limitations\u2014of open-ended learning, which enables us to develop robust and flexible agents that can cope with complex real-world domains,\" Vinyals and Czarnecki <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaStar-Grandmaster-level-in-StarCraft-II-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning\">wrote</a>. \"Games like <em>StarCraft</em> are an excellent training ground to advance these approaches, as players must use limited information to make dynamic and difficult decisions that have ramifications on multiple levels and timescales.\"</p>\n<p>And this time around, it appears to have been a fair fight. \"I've found AlphaStar's gameplay impressive,\" Wunsch said of this most recent incarnation. \"The system is very skilled at assessing its strategic position, and knows exactly when to engage or disengage with its opponent.

It is a very well-studied crop disease, and it often serves as a model system to examine the interactions between microbes and their host plants. The pathogen is called Xoo, for <em>Xanthomonas oryzae</em> pathovar <em>oryzae</em>, and it makes its living by hijacking a number of rice genes that export sugars.</p>\n<p>Now, researchers have figured out how to edit the rice's genome to block this hijacking.</p>\n<h2>A TALe of sugars</h2>\n<p>Xoo secretes TALes (transcription activator-like effector molecules) that bind to the DNA near the rice's SWEET genes, activating them. These SWEET genes (Sugars Will Eventually Be Exported Transporters) are ubiquitous in plants. As their name indicates, the SWEET proteins transport sucrose across the cell membrane. Their expression is required for susceptibility to Xoo.</p>\n<p>Researchers thought that modifying the rice SWEET genes would confer resistance to Xoo, especially since natural-occurring resistance has arisen this way. But thus far, only a few Xoo strains have been characterized genetically, so it wasn't clear whether it had additional ways of attacking its host.</p>\n<p>In order to see how to most efficiently render the rice resistant to Xoo\u2014which of the rice's SWEET genes to change, and how\u2014an international team of scientists first examined 63 strains of Xoo, 33 from Asia and 30 from Africa. All of them were found to use TALes to induce the expression of SWEET genes.</p>\n<p>As a proof of concept, the scientists then used CRISPR to edit the DNA near three SWEET genes in Kitaake rice. This editing specifically targeted the DNA sequences that the TALe proteins stick to but left the surrounding DNA intact. It's far more specific than could be expected to occur simply by selecting for naturally occurring variants.</p>\n<p>The engineered rice was resistant to all known Xoo strains. The Kitaake cultivar is a variety of <em>japonica</em> rice that is optimal for such studies since it has a quick flowering cycle and high regeneration. In the future, this new resistant line can serve as a diagnostic test to assess the virulence of any new Xoo strains that crop up.</p>\n<h2>Testing on crops</h2>\n<p>Since it is a variety of <em>japonica</em>, it can also be harnessed to breed the resistant trait into Japanese and Chinese rice. But it is not ideal for breeding with the <em>indica</em> varieties that are grown in most of Southeast Asia and Africa.</p>\n<p>So next the team used CRISPR to modify two rice mega varieties\u2014those grown over a million hectares. In paddy experiments, the edited rice grew normally and performed much like its unmodified parents in terms of plant height and other agriculturally relevant metrics. Critically, it was resistant to three representative strains of Xoo. Although encouraging, the researchers note that these results hardly provide a sound base for going out and planting fields of the stuff; much more extensive field trials are required, along with complete sequencing to ensure that CRISPR did not generate any off-target DNA edits.</p>\n<p>Rice has over 20 SWEET genes, and only three are naturally targeted by Xoo. \"Broad resistance to bacterial blight at the SWEET promoters will not prevent adaptation of the pathogen, and the durability of this approach will depend on the ability of Xoo populations to adapt to recessive resistance alleles,\" the authors sagely note. They suggest that making large changes in the SWEET gene promoters might delay Xoo's ability to overcome the engineered resistance.</p>\n<p>Nature Biotechnology, 2019.

Breja is suing Juul for retaliation for whistleblowing, wrongful termination, and other violations.</p>\n<p>Overall, Breja\u2019s complaint paints a dark picture of the company, which owns a lion\u2019s share of the e-cigarette market in the US. The former executive claims that Juul\u2019s senior management was motivated purely by profits and made many efforts to deceive regulators and customers, copying the despised tactics of Big Tobacco companies and trying to get customers addicted to their products.</p>\n<p>Breja accuses ex-CEO Kevin Burns of managing the company like a dictator, operating in a \u201cwin-at-all-costs, reckless fashion,\u201d and fostering a \u201cculture of silence.\u201d</p>\n<p>When Breja raised concerns about the company selling expired or soon-to-be expired products, Burns allegedly responded: \u201cHalf our customers are drunk and vaping like mo-fo\u2019s, who the fuck is going to notice the quality of our pods.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Toxic claims</h2>\n<p>Perhaps more concerning, Breja alleges that Juul sold a large amount of contaminated products out of greed. According to Breja, the company struggled to keep up with demand for mint-flavored products after Juul decided <a href=\"https://newsroom.juul.com/juul-labs-action-plan/\">to pull other flavors from its retail stores</a> late last year. The move was meant to dodge further public backlash for the rise in teen vaping, but it resulted in supply issues that threatened profits.</p>\n<p>\u201cYou need to have an IQ of 5 to know that when customers don\u2019t find mango they buy mint,\u201d Burns allegedly said while berating Juul\u2019s supply-chain team and its suppliers for the shortages.</p>\n<p>In March of 2019, Breja learned that some batches of Mint eLiquid had been found to be contaminated. By that time, approximately 250,000 \u201cMint Refill Kits\u201d containing the contaminated liquids had already been shipped to retailers and were being sold to customers. The contaminated kits were equivalent to one million pods, the lawsuit notes.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit does not indicate what the contaminant might be. But Breja\u2019s suit notes that the contamination issue arose \u201cin the wake of consumers recently having reported suffering seizures due to the use of Juul\u2019s products.\u201d</p>\n<p>In an emailed statement to Ars, a Juul spokesperson responded:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mr. Breja\u2019s claims are baseless. He was terminated in March 2019 because he failed to demonstrate the leadership qualities needed in his role. The allegations concerning safety issues with Juul products are equally meritless, and we already investigated the underlying manufacturing issue and determined the product met all applicable specifications. The company will vigorously defend this lawsuit.</p></blockquote>\n<p> Breja\u2019s claims come at a critical time for Juul. The company is facing intense criticism for helping to light up an epidemic of youth vaping, particularly after revelations this summer that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/09/juul-gave-presentations-in-schools-to-kids-and-the-fda-is-fuming/\">Juul directly pitched its products to teens while they were in school</a>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the country is dealing with a rash of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/vaping-linked-lung-illness-looks-like-exposure-to-mustard-gas-doctors-say/\">unexplained lung injuries that have been linked to vaping</a>. Federal and state health investigators have not been able to determine what vaping products or contaminants could be causing the illnesses, but most cases have involved black-market products containing THC (the psychoactive component of cannabis)\u2014not nicotine products or Juul products, specifically.</p>\n<p>As of October 22, 2019, there have <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information\">been 1,604 reported cases of vaping-related injuries</a> in 49 states, including 34 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>\n<p>Kevin Burns stepped down as Juul\u2019s CEO in September. He was replaced by K. C. Crosthwaite, the former chief growth officer at Altria Group Inc., formerly Philip Morris Companies, Inc., before the appointment. On Tuesday, the company confirmed plans to lay off 500 employees by the end of the year as part of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/juul-to-cut-about-500-jobs-11572301778\">necessary reset</a>.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593843&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Allen Brack <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-president-clarifies-decision-to-ban-hearthstone-player-and-two-casters-over-hong-kong-controversy/\">said in an interview with PC Gamer this weekend</a> that the company will not be reversing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-reinstates-hong-kong-protestors-prize-says-china-had-no-influence/\">a six-month suspension</a> for Ng \"Blitzchung\" Wai Chung and two <em>Hearthstone</em> casters that were involved in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/blizzard-bans-pro-hearthstone-gamer-for-statement-supporting-hong-kong/\">Hong Kong-related protests on a live esports stream last month</a>.</p>\n<p>In explaining that decision,Brack reiterated the message that Blizzard supports free speech and encourages employees and players to say what they want in \"all kinds of ways and all kinds of places.\" The one exception to that, he said, is \"official broadcasts,\" including Blizzard-sponsored esports events, which the company wants to be \"focused on the games.\"</p>\n<p>\"Again, it's not about the content of Blitzchung's message,\"Brack said, echoing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-reinstates-hong-kong-protestors-prize-says-china-had-no-influence/\">previous comments</a> from Blizzard. \"It's about the fact that it was not around the games. If we hadn't taken action, if we hadn't done something, you can imagine the trail that would be in our future around doing interviews. They would become times for people to make a statement about whatever they wanted to, on whatever issue. That's just a path that we don't want to go down. We really want the content of those official broadcasts to be focused on the games, and keep that focus.\"</p>\n<p>Brack added that Blizzard employees, including \"esports athletes, our Grandmasters, or anyone who is participating in esports [are] free to say and do whatever they want on their social channels.\" That seems to directly contradict the reported experience of Justin \"Jayne\" Conroy, assistant coach for the Dallas Fuel pro <em>Overwatch</em> team, who <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-fuel/2019/10/09/fuel-assistant-coach-jayne-condemns-punishment-levied-hong-kong-hearthstone-pro-voiced-support-anti-government-protest/\">told the Dallas Morning News last month</a> that Blizzard asked him to remove a tweet criticizing the Blitzchung decision.</p>\n<p>Brack's interview comes after he issued a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/blizzard-president-gives-vague-apology-for-hong-kong-protest-response/\">vague apology</a> from the Blizzcon stage Friday, in which he accepted \"accountability\" for the Blitzchung decision and said the company would \"do better\" in the future. The decision to keep the suspension in place comes despite pressure from <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943761/hong-kong-protests-blizzcon-2019-blitzchung\">Blizzcon protesters</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-belatedly-punishes-college-hearthstone-team-for-hong-kong-protest/\">pro <em>Hearthstone</em> players</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/blizzard-employees-staged-a-walkout-to-protest-banned-pro-hong-kong-gamer\">Blizzard employees</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/boycottblizzard\">Twitter hashtaggers</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/us-legislators-urge-blizzard-to-reverse-hong-kong-protest-player-ban/\">a bipartisan group of US legislators</a>.</p>\n<p>Brack also reiterated in the interview that Chinese regulations and business pressure has nothing to do with the company's decisions regarding Blitzchung. Though <em>Hearthstone</em> is available in China,Brack stressed that it was only through local publishing partner NetEase, and that Blizzard itself is \"not legally allowed to operate or to publish games in China.\"</p>\n<p>Brack also said NetEase was to blame for a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfjldg/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/\">Weibo post from Blizzard China</a> shortly after Blitzchung's on-stream protest, which suggested the company would \"always respect and defend the pride of [China].\"Brack said directly that Blizzard \"did not authorize [the post]. We did not approve it. We would not have approved it had they asked.\"</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the interview, though, Brack says that Blizzard Taiwan, <em>Hearthstone</em> leadership, and Blizzard's \"esports team\" were all \"in conversation [with NetEase] around the issue.\" Together, Brack said, those groups \"acted very rapidly and we acted very quickly\" in handing out Blitzchung's initial ban, using an amount of haste that Brack now calls \"the failure of this story.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595979&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Under the power of its main launch abort engines, the capsule accelerated to 650mph in just 5 seconds during a demonstration of its escape system.</p>\n<p>The pad abort test marked a critical milestone as Boeing seeks to fly humans to the International Space Station sometime in 2020. During Monday's 75-second test, Starliner appeared to successfully demonstrate its ability to rapidly escape from a problem with its Atlas V rocket during launch.</p>\n<p>The test evidently proceeded nominally until the main parachutes deployed\u2014only two rather than three emerged from the capsule as it descended to the desert floor. During the webcast, both Boeing's Jessica Landa and NASA's Dan Huot said the deployment of two parachutes fell within the safety requirements of the system, and that this result was \"within the bounds\" of this test.</p>\n\n<p>However, the issue of parachutes have bedeviled both Boeing and SpaceX during their development of spacecraft to take humans into orbit for NASA's commercial crew program. Both companies have had failures during their test programs and have had to change their chute designs. Parachutes are an old technology, but they are very hard to get right and represent a single-point failure during a spaceflight.</p>\n<p>While it is true that Starliner could return from space with just two of three parachutes functioning, it seems reasonable that NASA will want to spend some time studying this particular failure to fully understand its cause. Boeing has planned an orbital flight test of the Starliner vehicle\u2014there will be no astronauts on board this mission\u2014for December 17. If this test proceeds on schedule, it will send a strong signal that neither NASA nor Boeing is particularly concerned about this parachute failure.</p>\n<p>One other notable event during Monday's test was the large amount of orange smoke from dinitrogen tetroxide propellant that emanated from Starliner's Service Module as it came down to the ground. Some of this drifted across the area where the capsule came to rest, potentially fouling the recovery site. It was not immediately clear whether this presented a real issue.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595863&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

The timing of the walruses' disappearance suggests that the population's loss may be one of the earliest known examples of humans driving a marine species to local extinction.</p>\n<h2>The ghost of walruses past</h2>\n<p>Walruses used to be a major feature of life in Iceland. Several settlements and landmarks along Iceland\u2019s coast still bear names that refer to walruses, and a few of the medieval Sagas (the stories of the island\u2019s early settler families) even mention them. The Saga of Hrafin Sveinbjarnarson, written down sometime in the late 1100s, tells the story of a chieftain who killed a walrus and brought its tusks and skull to Canterbury Cathedral in England. But the walruses themselves have been reduced to only a few ancient bones and tusks.</p>\n<p>Did the walruses disappear before or after the Norse arrived? In other words, did the Norse kill off Iceland\u2019s walruses, or did the population die of natural causes? Because Iceland has no living walruses today, historians have debated whether the place names referred to places where walruses were living when people arrived or just places where settlers found the skulls and tusks of long-dead animals. The walrus tusks that Hrafin Sveinbjarnarson delivered to England could have been part of a thriving Icelandic walrus population, but it could also have been only a lost wanderer from more distant shores.</p>\n<p>To learn more about Iceland\u2019s pinniped past, evolutionary genomicist Xenia Keighley of the University of Copenhagen and her colleagues radiocarbon dated and sequenced DNA from 34 samples of bones and tusks from walruses in the Icelandic Museum of Natural History. The DNA studies also showed that Iceland\u2019s long-lost walruses were a distinct branch of the walrus family. The oldest walrus remains in the museum, dating to 5502-5332 BCE, were related to the ancestors of today\u2019s Atlantic walrus population. More recent samples, though, belonged to a separate mitochondrial branch of the walrus family tree, genetically distinct from every group that\u2019s known in the North Atlantic\u2014including the older Icelandic walruses.</p>\n<p>\u201cI would suspect that the most recent clade represent a colonization event that replaced the lineage represented by the old sample, rather than the old sample being a direct ancestor to the more recent clade,\u201d co-author Morten Olsen, also an evolutionary genomicist at the University of Copenhagen, told Ars.</p>\n<p>Radiocarbon dates of the bones, combined with the walruses\u2019 genomes, provided an estimate of the size of their breeding population, which suggested that walruses had lived on Iceland\u2019s coasts for around 7,500 years. Although their numbers had been small\u2014perhaps around 1,000 walruses at any one time\u2014their foothold on the island had been pretty stable until around 1213-1330 CE, well after Norse settlement began in 870 CE.</p>\n<h2>Blame the Vikings</h2>\n<p>So what happened to Iceland\u2019s walruses? As always, the answer is complex, but much of the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the Norse. Settlers arrived in Iceland and began hunting walrus for the European ivory trade at a time when Iceland\u2019s walrus population was already struggling with a shifting environment and a series of volcanic eruptions.</p>\n<p>Walrus ivory was a major trade commodity in markets across Europe for much of the early Middle Ages, and the Norse hunted walrus around most of their territory in the North Atlantic. <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0978\">According to a 2018 study</a> of DNA from walrus skulls and tusks found in Western European archaeological sites, most of Europe\u2019s supply of walrus ivory came from a walrus clade (a group of related animals with a common ancestor) living in Greenland, which was home to tens of thousands of walruses. Iceland\u2019s much smaller walrus population would have been a drop in the bucket by comparison, but the ivory trade would still have put pressure on Iceland\u2019s small population.</p>\n<p>When the first Norse hunters reached them, Icelandic walruses were already facing challenges from the Medieval Warm Period (700 to 1100 CE). A few centuries of relatively warm climate in the North Atlantic were helpful to human explorers, but not so great for walruses, which rely on sea ice as a place to haul themselves out of the water. And at the same time, volcanoes erupted several times near some of the walruses\u2019 key haul-out sites on land. It\u2019s no wonder the walruses couldn\u2019t survive all of that <em>and</em> Vikings.</p>\n<p>Some evidence suggests that <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2018.0961\">a Roman fishing industry may have wiped out grey whales</a> in the North Atlantic a few hundred years before the Viking Age, but otherwise the Norse may have been the first to wipe out a whole population of animals for profit.</p>\n<p><em>Molecular Biology and Evolution</em>, 2019.

This is good news\u2014despite the impressive sales numbers Google says it has for the original Google Wi-Fi, the product never ranked very well in performance tests at <a href=\"https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-wi-fi-mesh-networking-kits/\">Wirecutter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.smallnetbuilder.com/wireless/wireless-reviews/33125-wi-fi-system-roundup?showall=&amp;start=4\">Smallnetbuilder</a>, or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/04/send-wi-fi-companies-floor-plans-receive-the-ultimate-mesh-networking-test/3/\">here</a> at Ars.</p>\n<p>In fact, Google claimed that the new Nest Wi-Fi would cover \"up to 3,800 square feet.\" This raised our eyebrows immediately, since one square foot is very much not like another\u2014my own 3,500 square foot house is a particular bear to cover due to the downstairs floor having plenty of packed earth occluding the line-of-sight between that entire floor and the router, for example.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/top-floor-annotated-1-1440x971-980x661.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The top floor of our test house is relatively straightforward\u2014although like many houses, it suffers from terrible router placement nowhere near its center.

And heaven help you once you get into turn-of-the-century chicken-wire-and-daub walls, or apartments with central elevator shafts, and so forth.</p>\n<p>The good news is, a two-piece Google Wi-Fi system <em>did</em> cover even my challenging 3,500 square foot house\u2014an impressive achievement, and a clear win over the original Google Wi-Fi.</p>\n<h2>Nest Wi-Fi is all new</h2>\n<p>It wasn't clear from the launch announcements, but Nest Wi-Fi really is more than just Google Wi-Fi plus a smart speaker. The Nest Router is a 4x4 AC2200 access point and router, and the Nest Point is a 2x2 AC1200 access point. Each of the original Google Wi-Fi nodes was also an AC1200 2x2 access point, but Nest Wi-Fi points are updated with a newer and better wireless chipset, with additional RAM and a CPU nearly <a href=\"https://support.google.com/wifi/answer/6280668?hl=en\">twice</a> as fast as the original's. Granted, a lot of that new CPU power and RAM is really there to power the Google Assistant\u2014but also it comes in handy for general network use.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nest-wifi-tops-980x735.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The packaging for Nest Wi-Fi is very similar to that for the original Google Wi-Fi.

Google does still sell three-piece kits, as well as individual Points and Routers that can be added into existing networks, and we hope to update and retest with an additional Nest Point soon.</p>\n<p>Although Nest Wi-Fi isn't <em>just</em> Google Wi-Fi with a smart speaker, the Assistant is a big piece of Google's sales pitch for the new kit. We don't feel there's much to say about it that hasn't already been said about the other Google Home Assistant products, though.</p>\n<p>If you own a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/11/google-home-review-a-step-forward-for-hotwords-a-step-backward-in-capability/\">Google Home</a> smart speaker, the Assistant in Nest Wi-Fi is going to seem very familiar\u2014in everything from overall sound to listening ability to some occasional bugginess. The smart speaker functionality isn't in the Nest Router, though\u2014only in the Nest Points. It's loud without being overpowering, sounds decent without really wowing you (think \"that cheap jam box you had in college and liked okay\"), and it listens well and accurately from significant distance. It seems to have a hard time coping with hearing around physical obstructions, though.</p>\n<p>For the most part, the speaker in our Nest Point worked as you'd expect\u2014we set timers, asked it to tell us jokes, and other normal things. With the Point atop the ten-foot tall island in the living room, it pretty much refused to accept voice commands unless we performed a chin-up\u00a0and spoke to it without the cabinet in the way. We don't hold that against the device, though; while atop the island is the best place in my house for the second node in a two-node mesh kit, we don't expect many people will have similar home layout issues.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, though, the Assistant was just plain stubborn. When asked \"Hey Google, play House of Pain,\" our assistant said \"Sure! Playing House of Pain on Google Play Music\"\u2014and then didn't play anything. After five tries in a row, we tried \"Hey Google, play 'Jump Around' by House of Pain,\" and that worked. After that, asking for just the band and not a particular song worked fine.</p>\n<p>We don't think this has anything to do with the Nest Point specifically, though, since sometimes the Google Assistant on Pixel phones gets similarly cranky.</p>\n<h2>Prepare for a long setup process</h2>\n<p>One of the drawbacks of bundling a Google Assistant in with a mesh Wi-Fi kit is the sheer length of the setup process necessary to get both going at once. We were already familiar with the setup process for both Google Home and Google Wi-Fi, but still ended up needing better than half an hour to get everything operational. We took thirty setup screenshots along the way\u2014and deleted an awful lot more. There's a <em>lot</em> of \"next\" and \"okay\" and deciding whether or not to accept multiple different kinds of telemetry to get through before you can start playing.</p>\n<p>If you're really, really excited about your new Nest Wi-Fi kit, this might be okay. For us, it produced significant \"setup fatigue\"\u2014we feel this process could be streamlined substantially.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/google-home-setup-00-980x1960.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          You don't download a Nest Wi-Fi app\u2014you use the Google Home app. We already had this installed due to playing around with Google Home and Google Home Mini last year.\n\nThis wasn't the most intuitive way to start the setup process, since Wi-Fi isn't actually mentioned anywhere yet.

This did not necessitate any additional voice recordings.</p>\n<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>\n<h2>Testing the Wi-Fi</h2>\n<p>At Ars, we're always on the lookout for ways to improve our testing metrics. In the past, we've used <a href=\"https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/network-testing/blob/master/README.md\">netburn</a> to variously model 4K streaming, HTTP downloads, web-browsing, and more. Each workload stresses a Wi-Fi network in different ways\u2014but if your tests get too complex, they're difficult to interpret, and may also not test all sites in your environment equally.</p>\n<p>We think we've improved things significantly this time around by cutting it down to four basic tests.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Full rate download, all stations (STAs) simultaneously</strong>\u2014in this test, we repeatedly download a 1MB file via HTTP as fast as possible from each of our four test stations (laptops) at once. Ideally we'll not only see lots of throughput, we'll see relatively <em>equal</em> throughput at all sites. Some Wi-Fi routers or mesh kits will allow one STA to \"starve\" others when they're all clamoring for bandwidth at once, and that's not what we want to see here.</li>\n<li><strong>Full rate download, each STA solo</strong>\u2014in this test, we repeatedly download a 1MB file via HTTP at each STA. Each station gets to fly solo, though\u2014this is what you can expect for simple throughput in an uncongested network where you're not competing with neighbors, roommates, spouses, IoT gear, etc. for airtime.</li>\n<li><strong>1080P streaming and browsing torture test\u2014</strong>this is where it starts getting interesting! In this test, all four STAs\u00a0emulate both a 1080P streaming session (fetching 1MB chunks of data by HTTP, rate-limited to 5Mbps by sleeping between fetches as necessary) and also a web browsing workload (fetching \"webpages\" at 1Mbps; where each \"page\" consists of sixteen 128KB files, fetched in parallel over HTTP). We monitor both the streaming and browsing results. For the streams to succeed, they need to average 4.5Mbps or better; for the browsing to succeed, the mean latency should be under 1000ms maximum.</li>\n<li><strong>4K streaming and browsing torture test</strong>\u2014this is just like the 1080P torture test, but we're requesting 20Mbps per stream instead of 5Mbps. Few Wi-Fi networks will be able to feed four separate 4K streams to distant stations simultaneously. Even fewer will be able to do so <em>and</em> provide good web browsing latency while they do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Placement of STAs and APs</h3>\n<p>Our four test laptops are located:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Along the inside wall of the large upstairs bedroom</li>\n<li>Underneath the living room TV (where a set-top box might go)</li>\n<li>In the lower right corner of the kitchen</li>\n<li>Along the outside wall of the downstairs master bedroom</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The downstairs master bedroom is a particularly obnoxious place to cover, since it's blocked from the router by fifty feet or more of packed earth and a concrete slab. Even the second node of a two-piece kit has to reach it by way of both a wall and a floor/ceiling at a nasty oblique angle.</p>\n<p>The upstairs master bedroom is also frequently a source of pain, as it's quite distant from both the router and second node. Multiple interior walls, cabinets, and more must be traversed to reach the upstairs master from either node.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/top-floor-annotated-1-1440x971-980x661.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          The top floor of our test house is relatively straightforward\u2014although like many houses, it suffers from terrible router placement nowhere near its center.                      [credit:\n                        Jim Salter                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>The APs\u2014access points, as in the Nest Router and Nest Point\u2014are placed in the router closet off the entryway hall and atop the big island in the living room, above the TV. The spot atop the island in the living room is by far the best place for a second point, since it can both reach the router closet with minimal distance and with a pretty clean line of sight, and also cover the downstairs floor directly.</p>\n<p>That does it for Nest Wi-Fi\u2014but since we updated our test protocols, we also needed a guinea pig to compare Nest Wi-Fi to. Since Plume's Superpods are our all-time heavyweight champions, we dusted them off and set them up again as well. Our Plume gear is a four-piece kit, and we placed one Superpod in the router closet, another atop the TV island, a third on the inside wall in the upstairs master bedroom, and a fourth in the den downstairs, directly beneath the living room TV.</p>\n<p>We were running short on time, so Plume did not get its usual 24 hour break in and training period\u2014we just blew the dust off, plugged it in, and started testing right away.</p>\n<h2>Cage match\u2014Nest Wi-Fi vs Plume Superpods</h2>\n<p>In one sense, this is an incredibly unfair contest\u2014we didn't even get the three-piece Nest Wi-Fi kit, so we're pitting a $270 two-piece kit vs a $400 four-piece kit. That's without even getting into Plume's annually billed membership, which <em>does</em> offer a lot of features, but adds to the cost. The whole \"pay a subscription for your Wi-Fi\" also rankles a lot of tech folks.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Google claims their two piece kit would cover up to 3,800 square feet\u2014so we gave them the chance to put their Wi-Fi where their mouth was.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nest-plume-chart-02-1-980x735.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          In the simplest test, we just max out the Wi-Fi bandwidth from each of our four test laptops, running solo. For the most part, Nest Wi-Fi does fine here\u2014but look at that downstairs master bedroom. Yikes.                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>When looking at the absolute simplest metric\u2014how much raw throughput can you get at each laptop when that STA is the only one active\u2014Nest Wi-Fi hangs reasonably well with the Superpods. It did struggle in the downstairs master bedroom, but it was at least in the same ballpark with the Superpods everywhere else\u2014it even beat them in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>The real story when it comes to Wi-Fi isn't single device throughput, though\u2014the real pain happens when you're competing with other devices. When we asked for all the throughput we could get from all four stations simultaneously, things got hairier. In the simultaneous throughput test, Nest Wi-Fi provided considerably less throughput in <em>all</em> locations than Plume did.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nest-plume-chart-03-980x735.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Four 1080P streams isn't a very big ask from a modern mesh kit. Both kits do a good job servicing the four laptops here. The real test is what happens when you try to browse websites while all this streaming is going on...                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>We still believe the real test of a Wi-Fi network isn't throughput at all\u2014it's browsing latency, especially when the network is already congested. To that end, we ran simultaneous 1080P emulated streams <em>and</em> 1Mbps emulated webpage fetches on all four stations simultaneously. Nest Wi-Fi mostly succeeded here in providing all four 1080P streams, though it's still struggling with that downstairs bedroom. However, things go off the rails when we look at browsing latency.</p>\n<p>It took nearly four seconds on average for Nest Wi-Fi to deliver a webpage to the downstairs bedroom, and about 1500ms to deliver one to the kitchen. It's worth noting that this really is an <em>average</em>\u2014meaning many of the fetches took longer than that. That's not a good experience. And while we call this a \"torture test,\" it's really not that far off from a normal day at many residences. There are two adults and three kids in my house, and it's not that uncommon for at least four of us to be watching different things on Rokus, tablets, and phones at once, while another of us tries to browse social media.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nest-plume-chart-05-980x735.png\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Now we've upped the stakes, replacing our four emulated 1080P streams with four 4K streams. The Superpods supply the four streams effortlessly. Nest Wi-Fi succeeds in the upstairs master bedroom, the living room, and (mostly) the kitchen, but fails sharply in the downstairs bedroom.                   </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Making matters worse, both of the Rokus at my house will default to 4K where available\u2014and more and more of Netflix's catalog is 4K. So for the last pair of tests, we stepped things up and asked for four (emulated) 4K streams\u2014requiring 20Mbps apiece\u2014and, again, tried to do some (emulated) light web browsing at the same time. This was a Herculean task because two of our four test stations were deliberately placed in very difficult to reach areas, and we didn't really expect either kit to succeed.</p>\n<p>Nest Wi-Fi was able to delvier simultaneous 4K streams to the living room and the upstairs bedroom, and it probably succeeded in the kitchen as well. Although the kitchen didn't quite get the 20Mbps it asked for, anything more than 15Mbps generally suffices for real-world streaming.</p>\n<p>Once again, though, Nest failed in the downstairs bedroom. 6.5Mbps is a third of what we requested, and less than half the bare minimum necessary for successful 4K streaming. It was no surprise that Nest Wi-Fi didn't do well on browsing latency during the 4K torture test, either\u2014again, we expect\u00a0<em>nothing</em> short of wired LAN or at least wired APs could handle this workload.</p>\n<p>But to our surprise, the Plume Superpods succeeded on both halves of the 4K torture test, delivering 19.9Mbps to each STA <em>and</em> supplying web pages with under 500ms browsing latency in all four locations.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>Nest Wi-Fi is a big improvement over the original Google Wi-Fi\u2014and, true to its claims, it did cover our unusually difficult 3,500 square foot test house. Simply \"covering\" a house isn't the same thing as making everything work the way you want it to, though. We think many home users will expect a mix of video streaming and web browsing by everyone in the house at once to work seamlessly.</p>\n<p>Nest Wi-Fi is\u00a0capable of getting that job done under most circumstances, but there's still room for improvement with how quickly, consistently, and reliably it does so in challenging environments. If all you're looking for is great Wi-Fi, you can do better\u2014we don't see the value in buying Nest Wi-Fi if you aren't completely sold on the integrated smart speaker.</p>\n<p>Given the price point and the good-but-not-amazing Wi-Fi in Nest, we see it as best suited to those people who are all-in on voice commands. If you want smart speakers everywhere <em>and</em> good Wi-Fi coverage, it's going to be difficult to beat Nest as an all-in-one product.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595701&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Mozilla also said that Internet providers have been giving inaccurate information to lawmakers and urged Congress to \"publicly probe current ISP data collection and use policies.\"</p>\n<p>DNS over HTTPS helps keep eavesdroppers from seeing what DNS lookups your browser is making. This can make it more difficult for ISPs or other third parties to monitor what websites you visit.</p>\n<p>\"Unsurprisingly, our work on DoH [DNS over HTTPS] has prompted a campaign to forestall these privacy and security protections, as demonstrated by the <a href=\"https://www.ncta.com/sites/default/files/2019-09/Final%20DOH%20LETTER%209-19-19.pdf\">recent letter</a> to Congress from major telecommunications associations. That letter contained a number of factual inaccuracies,\" Mozilla Senior Director of Trust and Security Marshall Erwin wrote.</p>\n<p>This part of Erwin's letter referred to an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/isps-worry-a-new-chrome-feature-will-stop-them-from-spying-on-you/\">Ars article</a> in which we examined the ISPs' claims, which center largely around Google's plans for Chrome. The broadband industry claimed that Google plans to automatically switch Chrome users to its own DNS service, but that's not what Google says it is doing. <a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2019/09/experimenting-with-same-provider-dns.html\">Google's publicly announced plan</a> is to \"check if the user's current DNS provider is among a list of DoH-compatible providers, and upgrade to the equivalent DoH service from the same provider.\" If the user-selected DNS service is not on that list, Chrome would make no changes for that user.</p>\n<h2>ISPs complain about \u201ca plan that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d</h2>\n<p>Mozilla actually is planning to switch Firefox users to a different DNS provider by default, specifically Cloudflare's encrypted DNS service. But ISPs are apparently less concerned about Firefox than Chrome because of Firefox's smaller market share.</p>\n<p>In addition to the broadband-industry letter to Congress, Comcast has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/comcast-fights-googles-encrypted-dns-plan-but-promises-not-to-spy-on-users/\">giving members of Congress</a> a lobbying presentation that claims the encrypted-DNS plan would \"centraliz[e] a majority of worldwide DNS data with Google\" and \"give one provider control of Internet traffic routing and vast amounts of new data about consumers and competitors.\" Comcast and other ISPs are urging Congress to intervene.</p>\n<p>But a number of the arguments ISPs made to lawmakers are \"premised on a plan that doesn't exist,\" Erwin told Ars last week, referring to the ISPs' claims about Google.</p>\n<p>\"The focus of the lobbying effort has been on using Google as a boogeyman, given a lot of the antitrust concerns that exist today, to drive a lot of uncertainty about the potential implications of DNS over HTTPS,\" Erwin said.</p>\n<p>Mozilla's letter to Congress said the ISP lobbying against encrypted DNS amounts to telecom associations \"explicitly arguing that ISPs need to be in a position to collect and monetize users' data. This is inconsistent with arguments made just two years earlier regarding whether privacy rules were needed to govern ISP data use.\"</p>\n<p>Mozilla was referring to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/for-sale-your-private-browsing-history/\">ISPs lobbying Congress</a> to kill broadband privacy rules in 2017. The federal government's decision to eliminate privacy rules at the broadband industry's request means that home and mobile Internet providers are not prohibited from using customers' browsing histories to sell targeted ads or from sharing customers' browsing histories with third parties.</p>\n<h2>Mozilla cites ISPs\u2019 history of abusing data</h2>\n<p>ISPs have consistently claimed such rules aren't necessary because they aren't violating users' privacy. But their objections to DNS over HTTPS \"has raised questions about how ISPs collect and use sensitive user data in their gatekeeper role over Internet usage,\" Mozilla told Congress. Mozilla said it believes the privacy upgrade has \"become necessary to protect users in light of the extensive record of ISP abuse of personal data.\"</p>\n<p>That ISP abuse includes mobile providers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/01/t-mobile-sprint-and-att-still-selling-your-location-data-report-says/\">selling real-time location data</a> \"to third parties without user knowledge or meaningful consent;\" ISPs such as Comcast \"manipulat[ing] DNS to <a href=\"https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/redirectingdnsforads11.pdf\">serve advertisements to consumers;</a>\" Verizon's use of \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/verizons-supercookies-violated-net-neutrality-transparency-rule/\">supercookies</a>\" to track Internet activity; and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/att-to-end-targeted-ads-program-give-all-users-lowest-available-price/\">AT&amp;T charging customers</a> an extra $29 per month to avoid \"the collection and monetization of their browsing history for targeted ads,\" Mozilla told Congress.</p>\n<p>Web users are tracked by Google, Facebook, and other advertising companies, of course. ISPs, though, have \"privileged access\" to users' browsing histories because they act as the gateway to the Internet, Erwin said to Ars.</p>\n<p>There is already \"remarkably sophisticated micro-targeting across the Web,\" and \"we don't want to see that business model duplicated in the middle of the network,\" he said. \"We think it's just a mistake to use DNS for those purposes.\"</p>\n<h2>Mozilla\u2019s plan for Firefox</h2>\n<p>When Mozilla's plan is implemented, Firefox users will be automatically switched to a DNS provider that uses encrypted DNS and has a strong privacy policy. So far, Cloudflare is the only such provider that Mozilla is working with. Erwin said Cloudflare's privacy policy is \"best in class\" but said Mozilla is trying to bring on other \"trusted\" providers to give users a choice of which encrypted DNS service to use.</p>\n<p>Mozilla is rolling encrypted DNS out to a small percentage of its user base for testing and intends to deploy it to all users in the US later on. The browser will notify users when encrypted DNS is turned on and provide a method for opting out, Erwin said. Users who don't want to wait can already opt in to DNS over HTTPS by <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_manually-enabling-and-disabling-dns-over-https\">following these instructions</a>.</p>\n<p>\"We think the default approach is the right one because consumers don't have the technical sophistication or even the time to make an opt-in decision on something like this,\" Erwin told Ars. \"We think it's the appropriate role for the browser to set a strong privacy default.\"</p>\n<p>Firefox won't automatically enable encrypted DNS in some cases, however. When Firefox detects parental controls, it will leave the user's existing DNS service in place, Erwin said. Firefox will also leave the existing DNS service in place for certain business users.</p>\n<p>\"Firefox will detect whether enterprise policies have been set on the device and will disable DoH in those circumstances. If an enterprise policy explicitly enables DoH, which we think would be awesome, we will also respect that,\" Mozilla said in an <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2019/09/06/whats-next-in-making-dns-over-https-the-default/\">announcement in September</a>.</p>\n<p>Mozilla answers other questions about how DNS over HTTPS will work in Firefox in <a href=\"https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dns-over-https-doh-faqs\">this FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>Mozilla has established <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DOH-resolver-policy\">specific policy requirements</a> that DNS providers have to meet to earn a spot in Firefox's encrypted-DNS program. For example, DNS resolvers must delete data that could identify users within 24 hours and only use that data \"for the purpose of operating the service.\" Providers also \"must not retain, sell, or transfer to any third party (except as may be required by law) any personal information, IP addresses or other user identifiers, or user query patterns from the DNS queries sent from the Firefox browser.\"</p>\n<p>Mozilla's policy also forbids blocking or filtering content except when authorized by users or required by law. Mozilla further requires a public privacy notice that details the DNS provider's data-retention practices as well as annual transparency reports that document how the DNS provider \"will handle law enforcement requests for user data and that documents the types and number of requests received and answered, except to the extent such disclosure is prohibited by law.\"</p>\n<p>Mozilla's letter to Congress said that \"ISPs often do not maintain privacy notices for their DNS services,\" so \"it is unclear what data is being retained, how it is being used, or who it is being shared with.\" (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/comcast-fights-googles-encrypted-dns-plan-but-promises-not-to-spy-on-users/\">Comcast said last month</a> that it does not track its broadband users' Web-browsing histories and that it deletes DNS queries generated by its Internet customers every 24 hours.)</p>\n<p>Because there's so little regulation of broadband providers' privacy practices, Mozilla says it is up to browser makers to protect users. \"Our approach with DoH attempts to close part of this regulatory gap through technology and strong legal protections for user privacy,\" Erwin wrote in the letter to Congress. But he urged Congress to act, too, writing that \"to truly protect privacy, a combination of technical and regulatory solutions must be put in place.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595109&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

With its whip-smart dialogue, killer soundtrack, and rich trove of sly pop culture references, the show is almost too smart for its own good. I say \"almost,\" because this eclectic genre mashup turns out to be an outrageously over-the-top delight. If you liked Amazon's\u00a0<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/review-the-boys-is-the-perfect-therapy-for-chronic-superhero-fatigue/\"><em>The Boys</em></a>, chances are you'll like <em>Daybreak</em>, too.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major twists are revealed.)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Daybreak</em> is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Brian Ralph. His first graphic novel, <em>Cave-In</em>, was notable for having no words at all. <em>Daybreak</em>\u00a0was groundbreaking in a different way, told entirely from the perspective (both narratively and visually) of an unnamed survivor to an apocalyptic event, breaking the fourth wall to address readers directly. The young man wakes up to find the world he once knew destroyed, before a one-armed man appears and takes him under his protective wing. They are joined by other survivors, teaming up to avoid zombie-like creatures that lurk in the shadows but are never fully shown. It's a quiet, understated post-apocalyptic story that has <a href=\"https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/daybreak\">been described</a> as \"<em>The Road</em> meets <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>.\"</p>\n<p>Created by Brad Peyton and Aron Eli Coleite, the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_(2019_TV_series)\"> Netflix TV adaptation</a>\u00a0is more \"<em>Mad Max</em> meets <em>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em>\"\u2014and in a nod to the latter, the original Ferris Bueller, Matthew Broderick, plays high school principal Michael Burr. Set in Glendale, California, our main protagonist is high school student Josh Wheeler (Colin Ford), who transfers to Glendale High right before a nuclear bomb/biological weapon combination hits the region. The few surviving adults have become \"Ghoulies,\" doomed to crave human flesh and wander aimlessly in search of food while muttering the last thing they said before the bomb hit (\"Why so many superhero movies?\").</p>\n<p>With no adult supervision, the teens stick with what they know, grouping into \"tribes\" based on stereotypical high school cliques to survive. The Jocks dominate all the other tribes, led by the brutal former star quarterback, Turbo \"Bro Jock\" Pokaski (Cody Kearsley), and his right hand, Mona Lisa (Jeante Godlock). There are also the Cheermazons, STEM Punks, 4H Club, Game Overs, Disciples of Kardashia, and so forth. It works about as well as you'd expect from teens with no governing experience who have watched way too many movies. Punishment is meted out according to the rules of ancient Rome, except the accused must perform onstage for \"American Ninja Idol,\" hoping Turbo gives them a thumbs up to spare their lives.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/day11-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          New student Josh (Colin Ford) is befriended by Sam (Sophie Simnett).

He\u00a0is mostly living what he thinks is the high life, camping out in swank abandoned digs while looking for his missing girlfriend, Sam (Sophie Simnett), who he's hoping has managed to survive as well.\u00a0But then he has a run-in with the Golf Club (a lowly subgroup of the Jocks, who don't consider it a real sport because of the tiny balls) and rescues 10-year-old Angelica (Alyvia Alyn Lind), a foul-mouthed \"MENSA-level genius with flexible morality\" and a deep love of fire and explosions. She latches onto him as her best chance to survive.</p>\n<p>Josh gradually starts to attract other potential allies among his fellow surviving outcasts who haven't pledged fealty to Turbo. They include Wesley Fists (Austin Crute), a former Jock turned pacifist samurai, who hopes to redeem himself for past bad acts via the code of Bushido; Eli Cardashyan (Gregory Kasyan), a bit of a self-serving tool who has holed up alone in the Glendale Mall; and former biology teacher Ms. Crumble (Krysta Rodriguez), who seems to be the only surviving adult who hasn't gone full-on Ghoulie, in that she can form complete sentences and resists the urge to eat the kids.</p>\n<p>Like its source material, <em>Daybreak</em>\u00a0deliberately breaks the fourth wall to address viewers (and sometimes, the writers) directly\u2014a narrative device also used to great effect in Phoebe Waller-Bridge's hit series, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleabag\">Fleabag</a>.</em>\u00a0But it cleverly tailors the style to the different main characters, each of whom gets a chance to tell their backstories in <em>Lost</em>-style flashbacks. For instance, Angelica self-identifies as \"gangsta\" and adopts the <em>Goodfellas</em> voiceover technique for her featured episode. Wesley's story is narrated by the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA and illustrated with kung-fu movie animations. Ms. Crumble finds herself in a cheesy sitcom narration of her backstory (directed by Angelica with a canned laugh track).</p>\n\n<p>It would be so very easy to screw up such an ambitious mix of genres and complicated narrative threads, but Peyton and Coleite pull it off. And that's largely due to the strong writing, terrific cast, and well-developed characters, especially the teens, who reveal themselves to be far more than the stereotypical roles they've adopted because they're frightened and crave some semblance of familiar structure. Deep down, they are still just kids, a dilemma best captured by Angelica, whose tough, sassy exterior hides a lonely, vulnerable pre-teen who desperately wants to belong somewhere. Her deepening relationship with Ms. Crumble, who gradually becomes a demented mother-figure/mentor, is a highlight of the series.</p>\n<p>Sure, it's best not to overthink the outrageous premise, and some of the teen soap moments are predictable, but they are also genuinely moving. And more often than not, the writers subvert our expectations in creative, surprising ways. I'd wager there has never been an after-school special as graphically on point as when Angelica gets her very first period and has to figure out how to use a tampon while hiding from Ghoulies in an abandoned cereal factory restroom.</p>\n<p>Josh's search for Sam is nominally the broad narrative arc for the season, but it's the makeshift family he finds along the way that gives the series its heart. The teens didn't destroy the world, but they're the ones who have to rebuild a functioning society from the ashes. On the upside, the apocalypse gives the survivors a chance to figure out who they really are and re-invent themselves accordingly\u2014for better or worse, depending on the characters. <em>Daybreak</em> concludes with a final unexpected twist and several unanswered questions that neatly set up a possible second season. Here's hoping Netflix gives the show that chance.</p>\n<p><em>Daybreak</em> is currently streaming on Netflix.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1591973&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Check out our complete board gaming coverage at <a href=\"http://cardboard.arstechnica.com/\">cardboard.arstechnica.com</a>.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>For four days each year, the German city of Essen becomes the center of the tabletop gaming universe. The annual Internationale Spieltage fair\u2014better known simply as \"Spiel\"\u2014sees publishers from around the world unleash their most anticipated new releases.</p>\n<p>This year, more than 1,200 exhibitors from 53 countries showed off their games across 86,000 square meters of floor space. With so much to see, it\u2019s impossible to take in more than a tiny fraction of the games on offer. But for the past few years, I\u2019ve been wandering the halls on behalf of Ars readers, hunting for clever, cool, innovative, and entertaining new tabletop titles. So once again I took a deep breath and dove head first into a maelstrom of cards, dice, meeples, and miniatures. And here are my picks from the games I managed to play.</p>\n<h3>Obscurio</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Obscurio-5-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          Obscurio                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>A growing subcategory of board games challenges players to convey information using cryptic collections of images\u2014think <em>Dixit</em>, <em>Mysterium,</em> or <em>Deception: Murder in Hong Kong</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Obscurio </em>is the latest addition to the bunch. It casts you and your partners as wizards trapped in a maze-like magical library. To escape, you need to open a succession of doors and find your way to freedom. Each door shows a different arcane image, and one player acts as a guide, using picture cards and subtle similarities between different illustrations to point everyone else in the right direction.</p>\n<p>It might sound familiar to anyone who has played similar games, but <em>Obscurio</em> makes some tweaks to the well-established blueprint. For one thing, the guide can use a pair of magnetic arrows to highlight particular elements on the image cards, drawing players\u2019 attention to different colors, shapes, and objects. There\u2019s also a limit on how long players can deliberate over their decisions, and taking too long to choose a door incurs penalties which make things tougher in subsequent rounds.</p>\n<p>One player also acts as a secret traitor, actively trying to frustrate the group\u2019s effort to escape. In a game with such a pronounced element of ambiguity, there are plenty of opportunities to subtly derail your friends\u2019 progress, and it\u2019s all bound together with a Hogwarts-style aesthetic.</p>\n<h3>Pandemic: Rapid Response</h3>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Pandemic-Rapid-Response.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Pandemic-Rapid-Response-980x653.jpg\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Pandemic-Rapid-Response.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </p></div>\n<p>With the lineup of <em>Pandemic</em> games growing at a rate that would make a virulent strain of <em>e. coli</em> jealous, it\u2019s tempting to wonder how far the franchise can expand without running out of creative juice. <em>Rapid Response\u00a0</em>suggests it has a ways to go yet.</p>\n<p>Players control a team of specialists, each with different abilities, rushing to locations around the world to combat epidemics and prevent the fall of civilization. Rather than a map, though, the board now represents a plane, with different sections devoted to producing different types of medicines and resources needed to fight various infectious strains.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll do this by rolling and re-rolling dice, using the results to move around the aircraft and complete tasks while <em>en route</em> to the next global trouble spot. What makes this tricky is the remorseless time limit, forcing you to make quick decisions under pressure and inevitably creating more trouble in the process.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s a thematically jarring element where you can lose the game because your plane becomes too full of trash. But, like the original <em>Pandemic</em>, <em>Rapid Response</em>\u00a0skillfully creates a mounting sense of tension. The game wasn\u2019t the most fun I had with sand timers at Spiel, however\u2026</p>\n<h3>House Flippers</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-House-Flippers-2-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>This quick and quirky game sees players become rival property developers aiming to buy and sell a succession of homes, using the profits to retire to a life of luxury and leisure.</p>\n<p>You start out with a single card\u2014representing a dilapidated house\u2014and a plastic sand timer. Whenever it runs out, you flip it over and receive a wooden cube representing rental income. Rent money and the proceeds from house sales combine to let you buy more expensive house cards, and along the way you can acquire additional timers and staff who increase your takings, allowing you to develop a prestigious property portfolio.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s reminiscent of <em>Splendor</em> and the <em>Century</em> series of spice-trading games, where players aim to string together a succession of judicious deals as efficiently as possible. But what makes <em>House Flippers</em> deliciously different is that you and your opponents all play simultaneously, snatching helpful cards before your rivals and constantly keeping one eye on your growing collection of timers.</p>\n<p>At its core, the game is incredibly simple, but it creates a real frenzy at the table as you frantically claw your way towards the high life.</p>\n<h3>Marvel Champions: The Card Game</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Marvel-Champions-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>For years, tabletop studio Fantasy Flight Games has produced faithful adaptations of big-name pop-culture franchises. (See the <em>Game of Thrones</em> board and card games, <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> miniature battle game, and the succession of releases based on J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> novels.)</p>\n<p>Fantasy Flight recently added Marvel Comics to its collection of geek-friendly licenses, and at Spiel the company was showing off a new cooperative card battler in which players become mighty heroes working together to take down an assortment of dastardly villains.</p>\n<p>Mechanically, <em>Champions</em> feels like a slightly streamlined version of Final Fantasy's now-defunct <em>Warhammer Quest Adventure Card Game</em>. Players go head-to-head with an AI adversary. On each round, the antagonist works to fulfill their schemes, attacks the heroes, or dispatches minions to menace them. To save the day, players have to find clever ways to combine their strengths and overcome a constantly evolving set of dangers and obstacles.</p>\n<p>Each player controls a single character, and it\u2019s impressive how well their stats and abilities reflect their comic book representations. In our demo game, Spider-Man flipped and dodged to negate attacks, Black Panther deployed an array of advanced gadgets, and Captain Marvel used her powers of leadership to coordinate the heroes\u2019 efforts.</p>\n<p>Another nice touch is that heroes\u2019 character cards are double-sided, with one face representing their secret identity and the other showing their spandex-clad alter ego. Each side comes with different powers, and working out which can be of most benefit at different points is an important step towards victory. The game\u2019s pacing also does a great job of recreating an adrenaline-fueled comic book fight scene. Even though I\u2019m not a fan of superheroes, I\u2019d be more than happy to play <em>Champions</em> again.</p>\n<div><a name='page-2'></a></div>\n<h3>Trismegistus: The Ultimate Formula</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Trismegistus-2-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Named after the father of alchemy,\u00a0<em>Trismegistus </em>is the latest release from Daniele Tascini, the designer of last year\u2019s thoroughly-enjoyable-if-punishingly-complex <em>Teotihuacan: City of Gods</em>. It casts you and your opponents as aspiring alchemists attempting to conduct mystical experiments and transmute base materials into gold.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, that\u2019s far easier in-game than in real life. To pull it off, you\u2019ll draft dice representing various strange substances, acquire arcane artifacts, and publish alchemical tracts to boost your reputation. It\u2019s a head-scratchingly complicated process, but <em>Trismegistus</em>\u00a0only allows players to take a single action on each of their turns, meaning that while a game can take two hours to complete, the action moves along at a surprisingly consistent pace.</p>\n<p>To win, you must chain together a succession of small moves to pull off bigger combined effects, and along the way you\u2019ll pick up some useful new abilities as you expand your knowledge. This is the kind of game you can't hope to master in a single playthrough, and its publisher was only offering one-round taster sessions rather than complete games. But I saw more than enough to make me want to get it to the table again.</p>\n<div><a name='page-3'></a></div>\n<h3>Megacity: Oceania</h3>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Megacity-1.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Megacity-1-980x653.jpg\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Megacity-1.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </p></div>\n<p>As a rule, dexterity-based stacking games don\u2019t come with a lot of thought attached. Releases like <em>Jenga</em> and <em>Junk Art</em> might be fun, but they require steady hands rather than mental acuity. But in\u00a0<em>Megacity: Oceania, </em>you need both.</p>\n<p>The game has\u00a0players working to build skyscrapers as part of a futuristic floating city off the coast of Australia. Players construct buildings using plastic pieces drawn from a bag, with each structure resting on top of a cardboard hex tile. Different buildings come with different requirements, needing particular pieces in a variety of configurations. Once you\u2019ve built your masterpiece, you have to carefully push it across the table, linking up with your opponents to form a steadily expanding metropolis without sending all your hard work crashing to the table.</p>\n<p>Creating and placing buildings to most effectively boost your score takes careful planning, and maneuvering them into place to form a futuristic skyline is genuinely nerve-wracking. It\u2019s a combination of brains and balance you\u2019ll be hard-pushed to find in any other game.</p>\n<h3>1987: Channel Tunnel</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Channel-Tunnel-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>A small-box, two-player game from Spanish indie studio Llama Dice, <em>Channel Tunnel</em> hands players control of French and British engineers working to build an undersea rail link between their two countries. Despite its diminutive appearance, the game comes with some impressive depth.</p>\n<p>Both players want the prestige of carving out a longer stretch of the tunnel than their opponent. To do that, each will need to survey the sea bed, invest in technological upgrades, and raise money to correct any deviations in drilling.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s most impressive, though, is the game\u2019s action selection system, which lets players force their opponent to pay more to carry out particular tasks. It\u2019s a simple idea, but it brings a tight sense of economy to the game, and it throws up a string of tricky and interesting decisions. Hopefully it won\u2019t be long before the game gets wider international distribution.</p>\n<h3>5er Finden</h3>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img right medium\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9075995770910.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9075995770910-300x214.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9075995770910.jpg 2x\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9075995770910.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </p></div>Roll-and-write games have been hot in recent years, with releases like <em>Ganz Sh\u00f6n Clever</em> and <em>Welcome To Your Perfect Home</em> earning high praise from fans. But with a glut of similar titles following in their footsteps, there have been plenty of disappointments as well.</p>\n<p><em>5er Finden </em>isn\u2019t one of them. A game of quick wits and perception, it sees players roll a set of five dice, showing a collection of colored symbols. Players then scour their square-grid personal player sheets, hunting for groups of five connected spaces showing matching icons.</p>\n<p>The idea is not hard to grasp, but it\u2019s an intense race with everyone trying to spot matching groups before their opponents. There\u2019s also a more challenging \u201cpuzzle mode\u201d where players incrementally mark off more of their grids with each passing round, making it harder to find scoring combinations in an ever-decreasing space.</p>\n<h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Undaunted-3-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Historical battle games can be a bit of a niche, with lots of complex simulations catering to hardcore armchair generals. But this two-player World War II game offers a much more accessible approach. At its heart, it uses a deck-building system that will be familiar to anyone who has played games like <em>Star Realms</em> or <em>Dominion</em>. But it also employs a modular battlefield board and tokens representing a variety of units. Playing cards lets you command different squads, and you\u2019ll be able to move them between locations, scout unfamiliar terrain and\u2014of course\u2014engage your enemies in deadly firefights.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s really impressive is how elegantly this deck-building approach represents different aspects of battle. When units suffer losses, you remove one of their cards from your deck, making them harder to control. When you advance into new territory, you also acquire some useless fog of war cards, polluting your deck to represent the reduced efficacy of your thinly-spread forces. It\u2019s brilliantly intuitive, and while my demo featured a small-scale clash between basic units, the game comes with a campaign of scenarios to play through as well as more advanced squads with more powerful equipment and abilities.</p>\n<p><em>Undaunted</em> seems like a system which could represent any kind of armed struggle. While a follow-up focusing on British troops in North Africa is already in the pipeline, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to eventually see sci-fi or fantasy releases as well.</p>\n<h3><strong>High Rise</strong></h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-High-Rise-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>This upcoming game from designer Gil Hova sees players become property tycoons competing to build lucrative skyscrapers. In the process, though, they\u2019ll have to get their hands dirty. Taking different actions lets you acquire resources and build towering buildings, but in the process you\u2019ll gain corruption points, with the most corrupt players facing consequences at various points in the game.</p>\n<p>The result is that you want to be just corrupt enough to get ahead in the construction racket\u2014but not corrupt enough to be punished. It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, and aesthetically the game benefits from the jaw-dropping work of artist Kwanchai Moriya. Even as a prototype at Spiel, it looked enticing, and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing its finished form.</p>\n<h3>Paris: Cit\u00e9 de Lumi\u00e8re</h3>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Spiel-19-Paris-CDL-1-980x653.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n                            </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Another game with stunning visuals, this two-player competitive puzzle transports players to <em>fin-de-si\u00e8cle</em> Paris as the city installs one of the world\u2019s first electric street lighting systems. Over the course of two rounds, you\u2019ll lay down tiles to determine the layout of the Parisian electric grid, then lay building tiles on top to score points based on the size of conjoined areas you control and the number of streetlamps neighbouring your properties.</p>\n<p>Its scoring system feels a little similar to the award-winning family hit <em>Kingdomino</em>, but <em>Paris</em> comes with more to think about, including some special abilities that let you tweak the placement of your buildings or gain extra points by having artists wander the streets painting your illuminated constructions.

But in the past decade, a new front has opened up: infotainment.</p>\n<p>The newest entrant is Ford. Today, the biggest touchscreen you can get in a Ford is the Explorer\u2019s 10-incher. Most of its cars come with 8-inch offerings. Starting next year, Ford announced Wednesday, some (to be announced) vehicles will come with 12- and 15-inch touchscreens\u2014the latter is larger than any iPad\u2014stuck smack in the middle of the dashboard.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img right medium\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sync4.jpg\"><img alt='Sync 4 will run on screens from 8 inches to 15.5 inches, and includes enhanced multitasking.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sync4-300x480.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sync4-640x1024.jpg 2x\" alt='Sync 4 will run on screens from 8 inches to 15.5 inches, and includes enhanced multitasking.' ></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/sync4.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sync 4 will run on screens from 8 inches to 15.5 inches, and includes enhanced multitasking.</a> (credit: Ford)</p></div>The trend toward making car owners feel like they\u2019re at a drive-in theater has been going on for years, best exemplified by Tesla, whose Model 3 sedan has a 15-inch center screen that controls many functions that used to require buttons. In the smartphone era, people have been trained to expect <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/goodbye-iphone-se-small-phones/\">screens that are not just big</a> but regularly updated and easy to use. (Bringing a bazooka to this knife fight is Chinese electric-car startup Byton, whose <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/byton-tesla-latest-chinese-competitor-takes-screens-to-an-extreme/\">M-Byte SUV</a> will come with a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/forget-driving-watch-tv-car/\">four-foot screen</a>.)</p>\n<p>\u201cWe know the benchmark is cellphones,\u201d says Gary Jablonski, the chief engineer who runs Ford\u2019s infotainment efforts. That\u2019s why, along with screens that stretch farther, Ford is also launching Sync 4. The latest generation of its infotainment system will offer the kinds of features you\u2019ve come to expect from the computer in your pocket. The cloud-connected navigation system will liberate users from constrained libraries of points of interest, allowing them to search the map for things like their doctor\u2019s office. Traffic data will be more detailed and up to date.</p>\n<p>The bigger screens will allow Ford to show multiple applications (like navigation, phone, and radio) simultaneously, and to automatically configure their arrangement based on which apps the driver uses most frequently. As for the question of screens distracting drivers from the roads, Jablonski says a bigger display can actually help by saving drivers from fiddling with the thing if it\u2019s showing the radio and they need to see directions.</p>\n<p>While the system\u2019s female-sounding voice assistant doesn\u2019t have a name, Ford will let drivers summon it with a phrase like \u201cOK, Ford;\u201d Jablonski says his team is still workshopping options. You can still use the old-fashioned button to trigger the voice recognition system, but people have grown accustomed to verbally summoning their digital helpers. \u201cWe think that\u2019ll be the expectation in the car as well,\u201d Jablonski says. Ford will continue to support Android Auto and Apple Carplay (now via wireless connection), and models with Amazon\u2019s Alexa will keep her around.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img right full\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\"></div>To go with these upgrades, Ford is introducing over-the-air software updates. It may not use the capability to make its cars drive themselves, as Tesla has, but the ability to update the Sync system or adjust vehicle settings without dragging a customer into a dealership is a good tool to have. People are holding on to their cars for longer than they used to, says John Vangelov, Ford\u2019s embedded modem features lead. \u201cThis lets them keep their in-car tech fresh.\u201d</p>\n<p>These changes are built on a new electrical architecture that offers twice the processing power of the outgoing system, Jablonski says. And because the screen and tech wars are nowhere near a peace treaty, he made sure to leave some reserve compute to power the features of the future.</p>\n<p>Ford hasn\u2019t disclosed which models the screens and systems will debut on or how quickly they\u2019ll make their way across the lineup. But for an automaker that put Sync onto 30 million cars in 10 years, don\u2019t expect it to take too long.</p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ford-huge-screens-live-updates-cars/\">wired.com</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595227&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

We want to know where life may exist elsewhere in the galaxy, right? And where better than water-bearing, moderately warm, reasonably sized planets around nice, steady stars?</p>\n<p>Even so, what is perhaps more remarkable than the search for habitable worlds is the diversity of planets scientists have found. NASA has now confirmed more than 4,000 exoplanets by two or more discovery methods, and the agency has another 4,600 candidates as potential planets.</p>\n<p>All told, NASA has identified more than 3,000 planetary systems, finding planets of all shapes and sizes around all manner of stars. And there are some weird worlds out there. For example, there is the exoplanet TrES-2b, which is larger than Jupiter and orbits a star located 750 light years from our Sun.</p>\n\n<p>This is the darkest planet scientists have discovered, blacker than coal, with an atmosphere as hot as lava. (It makes the planet Mustafar, where Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker fought a fateful duel in the movie\u00a0<em>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</em> look like a garden world).</p>\n<p>Anyway, to mark Halloween this year, NASA has put together some splashy websites that show off these worlds and their stars, under the rubric <a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/galaxy-of-horrors/\">Galaxy of Horrors</a> and <a href=\"https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/alien-worlds/universe-of-monsters/\">Universe of Monsters</a>.

(credit: Aurich Lawson / Getty Images)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name='page-1'></a></div>\n<p>The Internet has done good things to the English language.</p>\n<p>That's the most important thing linguist Gretchen McCulloch has to say in her book, <a href=\"https://gretchenmcculloch.com/book/\"><em>Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language</em></a>. Though many prominent opinion-havers rage about the imminent death of the English language at the hands of emoji-wielding teenagers, the Internet has done no more harm to English than television, radio, or dime novels.</p>\n<p>In fact, McCulloch makes a compelling argument that Internet language, and emoji in particular, is restoring life to the relatively emotionless medium of text. For hundreds of years, public writing was limited to formal contexts like newspapers and books, written by educated people using very formal language for the edification of other educated people. Even fiction draws a clear line between informal dialogue and formal narration. On the Internet, on the other hand, the lines are much less clear. Private, informal writing (like shopping lists or notes passed between students at the back of a classroom) is now publicly visible, and the conventions developed by individuals or small groups for writing informally can spread and interact on a global scale. To McCulloch, this is more exciting than it is scary, and reading <em>Because Internet</em>\u00a0might convince you to feel the same.</p>\n<h2>Writing like we talk</h2>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center full\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/because-internet-listing.png\"><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">(credit: Gretchen McCulloch)</p></div>\n<p>McCulloch describes a variety of conventions Internet users have developed for informal writing, from emoji, which function like punctuation or gestures, to YELLING IN ALL CAPS, misspelling words in ways that reflect their own accents, or s t r e t c h i n g out words with internal spaces to make a point unmistakably clear. Each of these devices mirrors a spoken one, and their use allows Internet users to write in the same way that they talk, thereby expressing themselves more fully and more creatively.</p>\n\n<p>Even more fascinating, the amount each device is used changes over time in the same way they might in spoken language. It's a common complaint among younger Internet users that parents are all too eager to end sentences in text messages with periods, sounding serious or even angry all the time as a result. This isn't some conspiracy on the part of old people, McCulloch explains; people in different age groups tend to start using the Internet at different times and for different reasons, and those reasons show in how they text and tweet. For example, a person who first sent a text message using a flip phone with T9Word might retain some of the \"txtspk\" abbreviations that were necessary for saving effort and staying under the character limit in this tricky system. A younger person who's only ever used a smartphone will feel comfortable typing words out in full and considering the emotional weight of every letter and piece of punctuation in a message, including the previously innocuous period.</p>\n<p>McCulloch divides Internet users into several generations based on when and why they began using the Internet regularly, from \"Old Internet People\" who got their start on Usenet and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/a-1986-bulletin-board-system-has-brought-the-old-web-back-to-life-in-2017/\">BBSes</a> to the \"Post Internet People\" who have never known a world without the World Wide Web and are currently spending their formative years on Instagram and Snapchat. In the same way that children and teenagers adopt spoken language conventions from their peer groups, Internet users pick up informal writing conventions from the people they interact with most frequently on their social networks of choice.</p>\n<p>Her categories are spot-on: not only do I see myself in the \"Full Internet People\" who began joining Facebook and Tumblr in high school and college, but my friends and relatives of different Internet generations also see their experiences reflected in her categories.</p>\n<h2>Linguistics for everyone</h2>\n<p>In the introduction to <em>Because Internet</em>, McCulloch describes her goal as \"writing for the future.\" The book was created as not a stodgy treatise written in the English of the past for academics who might see it as some kind of relic. This is a book for anyone who uses English to get excited about, a book that takes advantage of the trends it describes. This doesn't mean the book is full of emoji adding layers of emotional and social interpretation to each sentence, however; it's still written in formal standard American English. It does, though, use some typographical conventions that haven't yet made it into formal style guides, like not capitalizing \"Internet.\" Even if Facebook and Twitter someday collapse, taking all our wonderful correspondence with them, future linguists will be able to pick up this book and say, \"Hey, they really did write like that!\" Or even \"this is when speech-like writing began to catch on,\" as McCulloch suggested in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/opinion/future-english-language-linguistics.html\">a <em>New York Times</em> editorial</a>.</p>\n<p>McCulloch is on a mission to make linguistics relatable\u2014and, hear me out, she's on a roll in that respect. She does this not only through <em>Because Internet</em>, but also through <a href=\"https://lingthusiasm.com/\">Lingthusiasm</a>, the podcast she co-hosts with fellow linguist Lauren Gawne. As its name suggests, Lingthusiasm shows off the hosts' enthusiasm about linguistics and calls on its listeners to get excited about a wide variety of linguistic topics, such as <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lingthusiasm/17-lingthusiasm-vowels\">how vowels work</a>, the ways people from different cultures <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lingthusiasm/15-talking-and-thinking-about-time\">talk about time</a>, and why efforts to create <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/lingthusiasm/01-the-one-langauge-peace-fallacy\">a single world language never catch on</a>. On Lingthusiasm, McCulloch and Gawne dispel myths about language and inspire the kind of excitement that turns curious students into scientists. And in <em>Because Internet</em>, McCulloch continues to demystify and delight.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595099&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Director Tim Miller's latest installment is great entertainment and a welcome return to form for the Terminator franchise, featuring a great cast, killer special effects, and nonstop action.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below.)</strong></p>\n<p>While technically the sixth film in the series, <em>Dark Fate</em> has actually been conceived as a direct sequel to the hugely successful first two films: <em>The Terminator</em> and <em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</em>.\u00a0So <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator:_Dark_Fate\"><em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em></a> pretty much ignores all the other Terminator movies as existing in alternate timelines. Best of all, it reunites stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton with James Cameron on board as producer. The film takes place two decades after the events of <em><a title=\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_2:_Judgment_Day\">Terminator 2: Judgment Day</a>.</em>\u00a0A new, improved Terminator (Gabriel Luna) is sent from the future to take out a young woman named Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes). A cyborg/human hybrid named Grace (Mackenzie Davis) joins forces with Sarah Connor (Hamilton) and the original Terminator (Schwarzenegger) to protect her.</p>\n<p>The film establishes its direct-sequel bona fides right off the bat with a brief but critical scene showing Sarah and her son John relaxing on a Guatemalan beach in 1998, having averted Judgment Day a few years earlier. (Edward Furlong was initially tapped to reprise his role as John Connor, but it ultimately didn't happen. Instead, Miller used CGI to recreate Furlong's youthful face from <em>T2.</em>)\u00a0Cut to 2020 and the arrival in Mexico City of two new visitors from the future: Grace and the Rev-9 Terminator. Grace manages to save Dani from the Rev-9's initial attack on a factory floor and escape, with the Rev-9 in hot pursuit.</p>\n<p>Just when things look dire, Sarah Connor comes to their aid and they hole up off the grid to regroup. Sarah is\u00a0understandably suspicious of Grace. And Grace comes bearing bad news: \"You may have changed the future, but you didn't change our fate.\"\u00a0Skynet never came into being in the altered future timeline, but an AI designed for cyberwarfare, dubbed Legion, did. And as before, a human resistance formed. Dani will play a key role in that resistance, so naturally Legion wants her dead.</p>\n      <ul class=\"gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide\">\n          <li>\n        <div class=\"gallery-item-content\">  \n        <div class=\"gallery-image\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/fate2-980x654.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div>\n        <p>\n          On the run: Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) and her brother Miguel (Diego Boneta).                      [credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.paramount.com/\">YouTube/Paramount Pictures</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p><em>T2</em> is hands-down one of the best film sequels of all time, and Miller clearly set out to recreate the same magic with a clever mix of old and new. A key part of that formula is upping the stakes with an advanced Terminator model that seems well-nigh impossible to destroy. The Rev-9 merges aspects of both the original and <em>T2</em>'s liquid metal T-1000: it has an updated underlying endoskeleton, with a \"mimetic polyalloy\" (almost ferrofluidic) overlay, like skin, that can split off to make the machine doubly lethal. Luna\u2014best known as Ghost Rider on <em>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>\u2014brings a ferocious intensity to the role, best exemplified by a scene where he mows through a crowd of Border Patrol agents without ever taking his eyes off his fleeing target, Dani.</p>\n<p>Hamilton is better than ever as Sarah Connor, <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/linda-hamilton-terminator-dark-fate-training-regiment-mackie-shilstone-1202765058/\">spending nearly a year</a>\u00a0on a grueling training regimen to get her 60-something body back into fighting shape. Her lean, ripped physique in <em>T2</em> made her a feminist icon on par with Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the Alien franchise. Yet, here, she's still allowed to look every bit her age. This is a weathered, embittered Sarah who has earned every one of those scars and wrinkles and has only grown tougher over the years. She\u00a0identifies with Dani because she was first targeted for termination around the same age, destined to give birth to a great hero of the resistance. Sarah assumes Dani, too, is only of value or interest because of her womb. Her expression when she learns that Dani is actually destined to <em>lead</em> the human resistance in this new timeline falls somewhere between wonder and regret.</p>\n<p>Reyes and Davis are both terrific in their respective roles, and Schwarzenegger once again brings his trademark deadpan delivery. The special effects are great, the pacing is brisk, and the stunts are appropriately over the top\u2014as always, there are plenty of explosions and property damage. If there's a flaw in this latest film, it's that everything seems just a little too familiar. Some of that can be chalked up to deliberate callbacks to the earlier films, but it's also because it's tough to hew to such a successful formula while still keeping things fresh.</p>\n<p><em>Dark Fate</em> provides a fitting coda to <em>The Terminator</em> and <em>T2</em> while introducing fresh characters in a new timeline to tee up a possible next film. Alas, the film seems <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/11/terminator-dark-fate-linda-hamilton-harriet-motherless-brooklyn-weekend-box-office-1202774477/\">to be under-performing</a> at the US box office this opening weekend, which is no doubt disappointing to those hoping to reinvigorate the franchise. Personally, while I'd love to see the further adventures of Dani, Grace, and Sarah taking on all the Terminators to come\u2014what, you think Legion will give up that easily?\u2014the tried-and-true formula is starting to show its age, and we already had a great TV spinoff with <em>The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>. Maybe it really is time to put the franchise to rest. At least it would be going out on a high note with <em>Dark Fate</em>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1593655&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

He texted a few of his students, who jumped out of bed and rushed his way. Together they loaded a radar-packing Ford F-250 pickup with gear and hit the road, gathering the Oakland colleague <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"//www.kqed.org/science/1950367/its-hard-to-predict-where-an-ember-hurled-from-a-fire-might-land\">on their way to the Kincade Fire</a>, which would quickly become <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/kincade-fire/\">California\u2019s biggest blaze of 2019</a>.</p>\n<p>Clements, <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/FireWeatherLab\">a fire weather researcher</a> at <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.fireweather.org/\">San Jose State University</a>, and his team arrived around 1am, driving past fire engines and evacuating locals as they steered toward the blaze. Normally they would check in with an incident command post first, where officials could tell them where the wildfire might be heading, but the conflagration was still too young and chaotic for such organization. So they drove on, trying to position themselves near but not too near the growing plume, searching for a spot not surrounded by brush or traffic, away from power lines that could fall on their heads. On their map they found a road leading to a vineyard\u2014lots of vegetation, sure, but chock full of water and therefore <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/california-wildfires/article/Yes-vineyards-can-help-stop-fires-as-they-did-14572161.php#\">quite resistant to burning</a>\u2014and turned in, landing a kilometer from a ridge line the fire was burning up to.</p>\n<p><div class=\"image shortcode-img right full\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\"></div>It was perfect: good visibility, out of harm\u2019s way, and most of all, well positioned for their equipment. Amid falling ash and fierce winds, they set up their mobile lab. With the press of a button, jacks automatically leveled out the vehicle, bringing online the only mobile radar in the Western US. The sciencing of the Kincade Fire had begun.</p>\n<p>A wildfire is a phenomenon of almost impenetrable complexity. Different kinds of brush burn at different rates, and even the same kind of brush can burn differently depending on hydration and humidity, which change hour by hour. Topography affects the trajectory of a fire, as does wind. For Clements, the goal is to better understand how wildfires can create their own weather and how the dynamics of the plumes affect the fire\u2019s spread.</p>\n<p>\u201cEverybody on Twitter is an expert on wildfire science, but nobody's actually been to one,\u201d Clements says. \u201cWe're the only meteorological team in the United States with this capability, because we're fire-line qualified.\u201d They go through special training and carry special equipment that could save their lives, like fire shelters. \u201cIt's like a foil bag that you wrap your body in. And you get down on the ground and you hope to hell that you don't need it.\u201d</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center full\"><img alt='Scanning the 2014 King Fire with Doppler radar as VLAT drops fire retardant ahead of the fire front.'  src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/fire-lab.jpg\" alt='Scanning the 2014 King Fire with Doppler radar as VLAT drops fire retardant ahead of the fire front.' ><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">Scanning the 2014 King Fire with Doppler radar as VLAT drops fire retardant ahead of the fire front. (credit: Braniff Davis, SJSU Fire Lab)</p></div>\n<p>There in the vineyard, though, Clements and his team were insulated in green vegetation, at a distance from the advancing blaze. With their radar now firing its radio signals, they began peering into the Kincade Fire\u2019s plume.</p>\n<p>While the doppler radar for your local weather report picks up hail and water droplets, this specialized device operates on a different frequency that can pick up ash particles and other debris. \u201cThe plume was sitting about a kilometer above the ground,\u201d Clements says. \u201cAs the fire got more vigorous, we couldn't see the fire, but we could see the radar showing the plume punching up to almost three kilometers.\u201d</p>\n<p>A glowing leaf landed nearby: it was a firebrand, the lit pieces of debris that winds pick up that can make <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/santa-ana-winds-might-dwindle-but-fire-danger-remains/\">California\u2019s wind-driven blazes</a> especially hard to contain. By flying perhaps miles ahead of the main blaze and starting new fires, firebrands can overwhelm crews. Last weekend in Northern California, winds blew firebrands clear across the Carquinez Strait, <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2019/10/27/fires-vallejo-carquinez-oct27/\">starting a new fire on the other side</a>. In cities they can land on roofs and start a constellation of new fires, as happened in last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-terrifying-science-behind-californias-massive-camp-fire/\">deadly Camp Fire</a>, which obliterated the town of Paradise.</p>\n<p>With plenty of green vegetation in the researchers\u2019 vineyard, the smoldering leaf was harmless. But it\u2019s these airborne threats that brought Clements out in the first place. By tracking the firebrands with radar, he can start to better understand how far these things can travel. \u201cWe can get the altitude of what we think the embers were,\u201d he says, \u201cand then we can use that information to create a model that actually forecasts spot fires correctly.\u201d</p>\n<p>With radar, the team can also better understand the atmospheric eccentricities of the wildfire itself. The conflagrations can grow so massive and intense that they create their own weather: as hot air rises, additional air rushes in at ground level to replace it. If the conditions are right, this kind of atmospheric disturbance can actually create <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/video/watch/extreme-events-fire-tornado\">fire tornadoes</a>\u2014140-mile-per-hour winds of swirling hot gas and debris, much of it aflame. It\u2019s as close as you can get to hell on Earth.</p>\n<p>Better understand the dynamics of the plume, and you can better understand the nature of wildfire. \u201cBelieve it or not, this is the most neglected phenomenon on the planet,\u201d Clements says. \u201cIt's like chasing tornadoes 30 or 40 years ago.\u201d Only in addition to unraveling the atmospheric dynamics, researchers have to consider how fuel burns and how topography influences fire and any number of other complicating factors. But every little bit of data, and every nerve-wracking drive into a firestorm, will help California navigate its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/californias-wildfires-are-the-doom-of-our-own-making/\">epic trial by wildfire</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/wildfire-chasers/\">wired.com</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595193&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Not long afterwards, the company said it planned to offer a fully driverless service to the public by the end of 2018.</p>\n<p>The rollout has been a lot slower than expected. Over the course of 2018, most of Waymo's cars continued to have drivers behind the wheel.\u00a0When Waymo launched its commercial service in December 2018, every car <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/waymos-lame-public-driverless-launch-not-driverless-and-barely-public/\">had a driver behind the wheel</a>.</p>\n<p>But now Waymo seems to be cautiously moving forward with fully driverless technology. Last month, Waymo told people in its closed testing program that they'd start getting rides in driverless vehicles. Now in a new piece for Techcrunch, Ed Niedermeyer <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/01/hailing-a-driverless-ride-in-a-waymo/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\">reports</a> on his own experience riding in a fully driverless car.</p>\n\n<p>Niedermeyer reports that the trip involved an unprotected left-hand turn, \"busy city streets,\" and speeds as high as 45 miles per hour. Niedermeyer says that his 10-minute ride from a park to a coffee shop was uneventful\u2014which makes sense given how carefully Waymo must have prepared for it.</p>\n<p>Still, this represents yet another baby step in Waymo's journey toward full autonomy. And despite Waymo's slow pace of progress relative to expectations it previously set for itself, the company still appears to be the industry leader. No other company is testing fully driverless rides on the scale or at the speeds Waymo is.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, the big question remains how soon Waymo can start offering fully driverless rides to the general public at a non-trivial scale.\u00a0Waymo has been tight-lipped about the scale of its current driverless testing or how soon the technology might become commercially available.</p>\n<p>Alphabet, Waymo's parent company, has spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing the driverless car technology. Last quarter alone Alphabet <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2019Q3_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=d41c776\">lost $941 million</a> on its \"Other Bets,\" which includes Waymo and other Google \"moonshot\" projects. Alphabet has vast financial resources, but eventually the company is going to want a return on its investment.</p>\n<p><strong>Correction:</strong> The original headline for this story implied that Niedermeyer was the first reporter to ride in a fully driverless Waymo car, but that's <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/video/5860372028001/#3090ba237481\">not quite true</a>. Niedermeyer does seem to be the first reporter to test the version of Waymo's technology now being made available to passengers in Early Rider Program.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595215&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

The man himself promised <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/with-a-shrinking-epa-trump-delivers-on-his-promise-to-cut-government/2018/09/08/6b058f9e-b143-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html\">on the campaign trail</a> to gut the Environmental Protection Agency and roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for vehicles. The chain of events so far has led to a faceoff among automakers, as Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, and BMW back more stringent guidelines out of California, and General Motors, Toyota, Fiat Chrysler, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, and Kia stand with the White House against the rule.</p>\n<h2>The story so far...</h2>\n<p>In 2012\u2014the middle of the Obama administration\u2014the EPA adopted a fuel economy standard that would gradually increase the average miles-per-gallon rating for most cars to 54.5mpg by 2025 (about 40mpg under real-world conditions). The agency finalized that standard in late 2016.</p>\n<p>When the Trump administration began in January 2017, that rule, like so many other policies from the Obama administration, immediately had a target on its back. In April 2018, the EPA officially said the standard was too high and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/epa-says-auto-emissions-standards-are-too-high-questions-californias-waiver/\">kicked off the process</a> to replace the rule with something weaker.</p>\n<p>California, however, threw a wrench in those plans. Most states can't set their own fuel-efficiency guideline, but California is a special case. For several decades, the smog-prone state has had a <a href=\"https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/california-waiver-facts\">perennially renewed waiver</a> that permits it to enforce stricter standards than the federal rule. The impact of that waiver goes far beyond the Golden State's borders: the other 49 states can choose to adopt California's stricter standards instead of the federal guideline, and at least 16 states have said they will back California's emissions standard rather than support the federal rollback.</p>\n<p>In July of this year, four major automakers\u2014Honda, Ford, Volkswagen, and BMW\u2014<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/car-makers-california-agree-to-emissions-rules-trump-admin-is-trying-to-kill/\">reached an agreement</a> with California. That voluntary framework aims to improve their overall fleet's average fuel efficiency by 3.7% per year, starting with the 2022 model year.</p>\n<h2>And then it got messy</h2>\n<p>The president did not exactly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1164311594081247233\">greet this new emissions agreement</a> with open arms.</p>\n<p>In September, the automakers all <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/trump-admin-threatens-california-automakers-over-emissions-deal/\">confirmed</a> they had been contacted by the Department of Justice, which was taking preliminary steps in an antitrust investigation. The probe sought to determine whether the agreement comprised a cartel that unfairly restricted competition, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-launches-antitrust-probe-into-four-auto-makers-11567778958\">first reported</a>.</p>\n<p>Separately from the antitrust probe, the EPA and Department of Transportation in September sent a letter (<a href=\"//cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/EPA-DOT-Puts-California-on-Notice.pdf\">PDF</a>) to put California regulators \"on notice.\"</p>\n<p>\"This framework agreement appears to be inconsistent with federal law,\" the agencies said. \"We urge you to act immediately to disassociate [the California Air Resource Board] from the commitments made by the four automakers. Those commitments may result in legal consequences given the limits placed in Federal law on California's authority.\" </p>\n<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom immediately accused the administration of trying to bully the state, saying, \"We remain undeterred. California stands up to bullies and will keep fighting for stronger clean car protections that protect the health and safety of our children and families.\"</p>\n<h2>That escalated quickly...</h2>\n<p>Matters escalated from there. Days later, both the House and Senate Judiciary committees <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/the-fight-over-fuel-economy-rules-is-getting-messy/\">sought to probe the probe</a>. California Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat who is running for the 2020 presidential nomination, said in her <a href=\"https://www.harris.senate.gov/news/press-releases/harris-calls-for-investigation-of-justice-departments-inquiry-into-automakers-working-with-california-to-reduce-emissions\">letter</a> to the DOJ, \"This chain of events raises serious questions about whether federal law enforcement is being used to coerce the four automakers to abandon their efforts to make cleaner, less-polluting vehicles. It also raises questions about whether the machinery of the Justice Department is being used for partisan political purposes, or at the behest of special interest groups that oppose even modest efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\"</p>\n<p>In response, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/09/trumps-new-car-emissions-plan-no-new-standards-yet-kneecap-california/\">revoked the waiver</a> that allows California to set its own emissions standard. California, as you might expect, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2019/09/20/california-sues-trump-administration-after-revoking-authority-limit-car-pollution/\">sued back</a>.</p>\n<p>California was joined by 22 other states, as well as several cities, in its lawsuit (<a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/65573354-d1b9-4c02-aa2a-d455db01a27d.pdf\">PDF</a>) against the administration, arguing that the administration's action, \"be declared unlawful and set aside because it exceeds NHTSA's authority, contravenes Congressional intent, and is arbitrary and capricious.\"</p>\n<p>The suit against California gained allies this week when the other major automakers <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/automakers-side-with-trump-in-legal-fight-with-california\">joined the fray</a> on the side of the administration.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594875&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

Allen Brack offered a vague on-stage apology for how the company failed to \"bring the world together in a tough <em>Hearthstone</em> esports moment about a month ago.\"</p>\n<p>Though Brack didn't delve into the details of that \"tough... moment,\" it's an obvious reference to the company's initial <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/10/blizzard-bans-pro-hearthstone-gamer-for-statement-supporting-hong-kong/\">one-year ban for pro <em>Hearthstone</em> player Ng \"Blitzchung\" Wai Chung</a> after he shouted a statement of support for <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/blunt-unplanned-police-tactics-fire-hk-protests-191101070008742.html\">ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong</a> on a post-match stream. While Blitzchung's ban was later <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-reinstates-hong-kong-protestors-prize-says-china-had-no-influence/\">reduced to a six-month suspension</a> and his tournament winnings restored, the damage was done among a vocal segment of Blizzard's fan base.</p>\n<p>In the wake of the Blitzchung decision, Blizzard was forced to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-calls-off-public-event-to-promote-switch-overwatch-launch/\">cancel a public promotional event</a>\u00a0and belatedly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-belatedly-punishes-college-hearthstone-team-for-hong-kong-protest/\">punish a college <em>Hearthstone</em> team</a> for a similar on-stream protest. The company faced both <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/blizzard-employees-staged-a-walkout-to-protest-banned-pro-hong-kong-gamer\">a brief employee walkout</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/us-legislators-urge-blizzard-to-reverse-hong-kong-protest-player-ban/\">admonishment from a bipartisan group of US legislators</a>.</p>\n<p>\"We moved too quickly in our decision-making, and then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you,\" Brack said from the Blizzcon stage this morning. Adding that the company \"didn't live up to the high standards we set for ourselves\" and \"failed in our purpose,\" Brack said, \"I am sorry and I accept accountability.\"</p>\n<p>How that accountability will manifest, and what if any changes were in store for the company, was less clear from Brack's statement. The executive only offered a vague promise to \"do better going forward.\" Brack asked the audience to notice \"as you walk around this weekend, I hope it's clear how committed we are to everyone's right to express themselves in all kinds of ways in all kinds of places. In fact we saw and heard many of you expressing yourself this morning.\"</p>\n<p>That's an apparent reference to <a href=\"https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2019-10-11-internet-freedom-activists-call-for-umbrella/\">long-planned protests</a> that are taking place this morning right outside the Anaheim Convention Center where Blizzcon is being held. There, dozens of protesters, who <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/1/20943761/hong-kong-protests-blizzcon-2019-blitzchung\">reportedly</a> started setting up last night, are <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzcon-2019-protests/\">handing out T-shirts</a> featuring <em>Overwatch</em> character (and growing anti-China symbol) Mei and offering support for Hong Kong. A truck carrying pro-democracy and pro-Hong Kong messages has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DreamcastGuy/status/1190289041196863488\">also been seen</a> circling the convention center.</p>\n<p>Brack's stated commitment to let those protesters \"express themselves\" rings a little hollow, since they are demonstrating on a public sidewalk outside of Blizzard's control.\u00a0And though Brack said he was committed to fans expressing themselves \"in all kinds of places,\" the company's stance on protest during Blizzard-sponsored esports events seems unchanged <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/blizzard-reinstates-hong-kong-protestors-prize-says-china-had-no-influence/\">from a month ago</a>: \"The official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where all are welcome. In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.\"</p>\n<p>Brack's apology was apparently received well inside the convention center, but the lack of specifics or commitments to change any policies seems unlikely to appease those gathering in protest on site and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/boycottblizzard\">on the #BoycottBlizzard hashtag</a>. We'll have more reporting on the goings-on at Blizzcon through the coming days.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1595107&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

And thanks to NASA chief Jim Bridenstine, it will be shown live.</p>\n<p>\"At my request,\" Bridenstine <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JimBridenstine/status/1189930291164569605\">tweeted</a>, the test will be shown live on NASA Television. \"Transparency for the taxpayer.\" NASA is paying Boeing $4.2 billion for development of Starliner and up to six operational missions to carry astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>Boeing had apparently planned to record the test, but did not intend to broadcast it live until Bridenstine intervened. \"A livestream of the Starliner Pad Abort Test is something we've been considering and planning for and are fully prepared to support at the request of our customer,\" Boeing's Rebecca Regan told Ars.</p>\n\n<p>Boeing plans to conduct the test during a three-hour window, which opens at 9am ET (14:00 UTC) Monday at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. During this test, the four main abort engines at the base of Starliner's service module will ignite and burn for several seconds, pushing the spacecraft off the launch pad. After this, smaller orbital maneuvering and reaction control thrusters will fire and eventually re-orient the spacecraft into a tail-first attitude.</p>\n<p>During the test, the spacecraft will reach an altitude of just less than 1.5km. After this, the spacecraft's parachute system will deploy, and the service module will be jettisoned before Starliner lands back on the nearby desert floor. With the test, Boeing aims to show NASA its spacecraft is capable of escaping from its Atlas V launch vehicle during an emergency and safely return the crew to Earth. The entire test should last less than 90 seconds.</p>\n<div class=\"video\"><div class=\"wrapper\"<iframe style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"980\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RZg5CCAyiTA?start=0&wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">CST-100 Starliner Pad Abort Test Animation </p></div>\n<p>Boeing had originally planned to conduct a pad abort test during the summer of 2018.

Symptoms typically start when people are in their 30s, and those include dementia and the loss of motor control. Despite having identified the gene decades ago, we've struggled to find a way to use that knowledge to make patients' lives better. The protein that is produced by the damaged gene is so similar to the normal version that targeting it has proven nearly impossible.</p>\n<p>But now, scientists in China have devised a way to specifically get rid of the damaged protein. They've identified molecules that can link the damaged form of the protein to a system that cells use to target proteins for digestion and recycling. Tests in mice and flies seem to indicate that this is enough to reverse many of the problems caused by the Huntington's mutation.</p>\n<h2>A dangerous expansion</h2>\n<p>Huntington's disease belongs to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinucleotide_repeat_disorder\">class of genetic disorders</a> caused by an expansion of the DNA within the part of the gene that encodes the protein. When being translated into a protein, the bases of DNA are read in sets of three, with each triplet coding for a different amino acid (or telling the cell to stop translating). If a protein needs the same amino acid several times in a row, the same triplet may be repeated multiple times.</p>\n<p>In most cases, this isn't an issue. But the machinery that copies DNA when a cell divides sometimes has trouble with repeated sequences, leading to extra copies of the repeat after a cell divides. Over many cell divisions, these repeats can build up, with dozens of the same three base code in a row. They all encode the same amino acid, so if a protein can tolerate the expanded stretch of that amino acid, there's not a problem.</p>\n<p>Some proteins, however, can't tolerate it. The Huntington's disease protein is one of them, as are a number of proteins associated with genetic ataxias. While it's not clear exactly what the defective form of the protein does at a biochemical level, it's clear that it's toxic to nerve cells. Over time, the defective proteins build up in aggregates, interfering with the functions of the nerve cells and ultimately killing them. The protein is also found in other cells and is critical for early development, but it's the death of nerve cells that causes the worst problems.</p>\n<p>All of these features make the disease incredibly difficult to target. The defective protein is similar enough to the normal one that you can't simply target it\u2014it's identical except for having more of just one of its amino acids. The normal version is far too important to simply get rid of the protein. The defective part of the protein doesn't have a specific activity and will vary in length, so it's not clear whether it's possible to design an inhibitor that blocks it. It might be possible to use a gene-editing system to eliminate the defective version, but we would have to get that into the vast majority of the brain cells if we want to prevent widespread die-offs\u2014something that's currently well beyond our technical ability.</p>\n<h2>Finding a linker</h2>\n<p>The researchers behind the new work decided that there might be an easier way of getting rid of the defective version of the protein. Although the repeated stretch of the amino acid doesn't have an obvious function that could be inhibited, it might be possible to find a small molecule that specifically stuck to it. And, if they had that, they could use the molecule to manipulate the protein's fate.</p>\n<p>To do so, the team created an array of about 3,400 chemicals and then identified ones that stuck to the repeated amino acids of the defective protein. At the same time, they screened the same chemicals as those that stuck to a protein involved in a process called autophagy. Autophagy is a process by which cells digest old or damaged components in order to recycle them into raw materials for further growth. Linking a protein with an autophagy component might allow the system to digest the protein at a high frequency.</p>\n<p>They pulled out two chemicals that seemed to stick to both of the proteins. They tested these and showed that they specifically interacted with the defective version of the Huntington's gene, not the normal one (they also confirmed it didn't stick to proteins in general by trying a couple of random ones). And, as hoped for, when given to cultured nerve cells, the chemicals reduced the levels of the defective protein, not the normal one.</p>\n<p>But the chemicals that came out of the screen were known to interact with other key proteins in the cell (such as the growth regulator Raf). So, in order to get something specific to the Huntington's protein, the researchers next looked at the structures of the two successful chemicals and identified a number of additional chemicals that shared some of the key features of these two. They identified two additional chemicals that could target the defective Huntington's protein for destruction but were more specific to it. These had the same effects as the original two, providing evidence that the reduced levels of the Huntington's protein was due to it being shuffled into the autophagy system.</p>\n<h2>Animal testing</h2>\n<p>With everything looking promising, the researchers switched to animal testing, showing that it worked with flies that had a mutant version of the equivalent gene. They then moved on to mice that had been engineered to carry a mutation similar to ones seen in human patients. Injections of the drug into the mice showed that the two chemicals could reach the brain and reduce the levels of the protein by over 20%. While not a complete elimination, this was enough to relieve the symptoms normally seen in mice carrying this mutation.</p>\n<p>As a final test, the researchers made stem cells from Huntington's patients, converted them into neurons, and tested the chemicals there. The chemicals worked and didn't cause any additional toxicity. Tests also confirmed that the chemicals had very little effect on other proteins in the cell, indicating that they weren't causing a general increase in autophagy.</p>\n<p>As a final test, the researchers tried it on a mutant ataxia protein. As mentioned above, several forms of ataxia are caused by an expansion of the same amino acid that's duplicated in the Huntington's disease gene, and so these may undergo the same sort of interactions with these two chemicals. The tests showed that they did, reducing the levels of these mutant proteins as well.</p>\n<p>This is a long way off from being an effective treatment, as there have been no clinical tests whatsoever at this point. But that's probably less important than the fact that people have figured out a way to potentially target it with a small molecule drug that can cross the blood-brain barrier. For all their limitations, small molecule drugs have a number of huge advantages: they can be taken in pill form, they're stable at room temperature, and we've got a very good understanding of the safety issues involved with mass-producing them.</p>\n<p>Even if these particular molecules don't end up working out, it's possible that the approach itself will lead to something that does.</p>\n<p><em>Nature</em>, 2019.

Allen Brack said, following its reveal (which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/blizzard-confirms-multiple-diablo-projects-in-production-news-by-end-of-2018/\">we already suspected</a>). He added that the company wanted to be sure the game was in a playable state before announcing it to the world. Hence, <em>Diablo IV</em>'s reveal included a lengthy gameplay trailer and a promise that all conference attendees could play the game's demo during the weekend-long event.</p>\n<p>The reveal included confirmation of the week's many leaks: that the game would revolve around the return of <em>Diablo II</em>'s villain Lilith; that the new game's art style would return to a black-brown-and-red motif, a la <em>Diablo II</em>; and that its first three revealed classes would be the barbarian, sorceress, and druid. Game Director Luis Barriga pledged to fully support a more \"brutal\" take on player-versus-player (PvP) combat, but he didn't go into further details on how that will operate.</p>\n<p>Though Barriga wasn't ready to reveal a release date or window, he did confirm the game will launch on Windows PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. That chosen series of platforms may peg the game's launch before 2020's holiday season, when we expect to see new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/sony-confirms-the-playstation-5-is-coming-in-2020-reveals-new-hardware-details/\">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/\">Xbox Scarlett</a> consoles... or it may simply be a placeholder announcement before <em>Diablo IV</em> winds up on newer consoles, anyway.</p>\n<div class=\"video\"><div class=\"wrapper\"<iframe style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7RdDpqCmjb4?start=0&wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">Diablo IV gameplay trailer. </p></div>\n<p><em>Diablo IV</em>'s gameplay trailer included hints of new mechanics, particularly the ability to ride horses\u2014and then chain attacks off of horseback, so that a hero can explode in a lightning burst off of its mount to attack nearby enemies. It also included clear callbacks to <em>Diablo II</em>, particularly the animations of loot and gold exploding from dead bodies, not to mention the obvious emphasis on the older games' color palettes. The trailer's mix of indoor and outdoor zones still made the most of that limited color palette in terms of biome diversity, while each revealed class already appears to have a mix of screen-clearing and zone-slashing powers, so that each can clear a room of diabolic baddies on its own.</p>\n<p>Ars Technica has boots on Blizzcon's floor, and we'll be back in the coming days with impressions of how <em>Diablo IV</em> feels compared to other classics in the series. We'll also see if Blizzard has anything to say about <em>Diablo Immortal</em>, the smartphone-only fork of the series that was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/diablo-immortal-on-phones-warcraft-3-reforged-top-blizzcons-announcements/\">revealed to a tepid fan reaction at last year's Blizzcon event</a>.

It would appear someone who gained unauthorized access was trying to take over the account. Several other people said their accounts had been accessed by unauthorized people.</p>\n<p>Over the past week, breach notification service <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> has reported at least 10 lists of NordVPN credentials similar to the one I obtained.</p>\n<div class=\"image shortcode-img center large\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nord-credential-dumps.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nord-credential-dumps-640x273.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nord-credential-dumps-1280x547.jpg 2x\"></a><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nord-credential-dumps.jpg\"class=\"caption-link\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> (credit: Have I Been Pwned)</p></div>\n<p>While it\u2019s likely that some accounts are listed in multiple lists, the number of user accounts easily tops 2,000. What\u2019s more, a large number of the email addresses in the list I received weren\u2019t indexed at all by Have I Been Pwned, indicating that some compromised credentials are still leaking into public view. Most of the Web pages that host these credentials have been taken down, but at the time this post was going live, at least one remained available on Pastebin, despite the fact Ars brought it to NordVPN\u2019s attention more than 17 hours earlier.</p>\n<p>Without exception, all of the plain-text passwords are weak. In some cases, they\u2019re the string of characters to the left of the @ sign in the email address. In other cases, they\u2019re words found in most dictionaries. Others appear to be surnames, sometimes with two or three numbers tacked onto the end. These common traits mean that the most likely way these passwords became public is through <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing\">credential stuffing</a>. That\u2019s the term for attacks that take credentials divulged in one leak to break into other accounts that use the same username and password. Attackers typically use automated scripts to carry out these attacks.</p>\n<h2>Shared responsibility</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important for readers to know these lists don\u2019t signal a breach on any NordVPN servers. The lists also don\u2019t indicate that the breach disclosed 11 days ago was worse than the company said it was. Rather, these lists are the result of mistakes both on the part of users and NordVPN. For users, the error is choosing easy-to-guess passwords and using them on multiple sites. Security practitioners almost universally recommend people choose a long, random password that is unique for every account.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d argue that NordVPN shares the bulk of responsibility for the high incidence of compromised accounts on its site. Many services such as Google and Facebook proactively sift through credential lists available on both public sites and the Dark Web. When the sites find credentials that match those of their users, the sites notify the users and require a password reset. The sites increasingly are not allowing users to choose weak passwords in the first place or credentials that have been exposed in online dumps in the past.</p>\n<p>NordVPN can take other measures to prevent malicious parties from logging in with users\u2019 poorly chosen passwords. Chief among them would be rate limiting and algorithms that detect and block unauthorized logins. It\u2019s hard to understand why NordVPN, a company that\u2019s in the business of providing security to users, is allowing so many of its users to fall victim to these attacks. In an email sent after this post went live, a NordVPN representative wrote:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Our security team is proactively scanning credential lists available on both public sites and the Dark Web, and, from time to time, we are trying to urge our clients to change their credentials, especially passwords. And then we are always trying to educate our customers through our social media channels, blog, and client newsletters that they must keep their passwords unique and strong. We are working at the moment on two other measures - two-factor authentication (2FA) and smart bot-detection system to enhance rate limiting.</p>\n<p>Credential stuffing is a growing problem not only for us but for almost every other digital service and website. If you look into marketplaces on the dark web or even more shady forums on a public web - you'll find hundreds of different accounts for streaming, music, games, health apps, and services sold illegally. All those accounts are acquired through the credential stuffing.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Readers who are NordVPN users should visit <a href=\"https://haveibeenpwned.com/\">Have I Been Pwned</a> and check to see if their email address is contained in any of the lists. If it is, they should change their passwords immediately. For most people, it\u2019s too hard a task to keep track of scores of strong passwords, but that\u2019s where password managers come in. This protection is especially important since NordVPN doesn't seem to be doing enough to stop these attacks from happening.</p>\n<p><em>Post updated to add NordVPN comment.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594961&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",

[credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2019/191101_2e.pdf\">Nintendo</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n  \n\n<p>Since the portable-only Switch Lite <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/nintendo-confirms-portable-only-200-switch-lite-for-september/\">was first announced</a>, I've heard from quite a few people who wondered why anyone would buy such a \"limited\" version of the system that can't be docked to a TV for big-screen play. In its latest quarterly earnings report, though, Nintendo is showing that there is plenty of interest in a Switch that can't, uh, switch.</p>\n<p>Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2019/191031e.pdf\">reports</a> it sold 1.95 million Switch Lite systems worldwide in the system's first 11 days on store shelves (i.e. through Sept. 30). That's a pretty good debut, considering Nintendo only sold 2.85 million standard Switch consoles in the three-month period through the end of September.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2019/191101_2e.pdf\">a briefing accompanying that report</a>, Nintendo presented an unscaled graph showing Switch Lite sales leveling off a bit in October. More importantly for the company, though, the graph also shows Switch Lite sales adding to sales of the original dockable system rather than replacing them.</p>\n<p>\"You can see how Nintendo Switch Lite added to sellthrough of Nintendo Switch, which continued at the same steady pace that it had set this summer,\" Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said. \"Looking at the state of this initial response, I would say Nintendo Switch Lite is generating its own demand, without negatively impacting sales trends for Nintendo Switch.\"</p>\n<p>Digging in a little deeper, Furukawa says online registration data shows a full 43% of customers buying the Switch Lite as their second Switch system. Of the 57% that purchased Switch Lite first, Furukawa says Nintendo is seeing a \"higher percentage of female users\" than it had for Switch in the past, \"signal[ing] further expansion of the female consumer base.\"</p>\n<p>Nintendo says it has seen \"consumers gain deeper understanding of Nintendo Switch Lite when they actually see and hold it.\" To that end, it is looking for ways to expand the availability of in-store experiences and other hands-on opportunities to get the Switch Lite in players' hands.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the report, Nintendo notes that a full 63% of its first-party game sales for the six months through September came from games that were released before that period started. Multiple releases from before 2019\u2014including <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, <em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>, <em>super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>Pokemon Let's Go</em>, and <em>Super Mario Party</em>\u2014sold over 1 million copies in that six-month period, well after their initial release. That's a pretty expansive long-tail success in a video game market that usually sees the vast majority of sales come in a game's first month of availability.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1594949&comments=1\">Read Comments</a></p>",
